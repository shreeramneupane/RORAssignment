1
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,260
(rumbling, whooshing)

2
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,337
REPORTER: We now turn to the
hostile nation of North Korea.

3
00:01:44,436 --> 00:01:46,638
The rocket they are testing
is believed to be big enough

4
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:49,542
to reach the West Coast
of the United States.

5
00:01:49,641 --> 00:01:52,111
Today, an official
of the United Nations

6
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:55,647
tried to tell the world--
so there will be no mistake--

7
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:59,118
that we are living in the midst
of a modern-day Hitler.

8
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:02,588
A young, untested leader
with nuclear ambition.

9
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:04,356
-Kim Jong-un.
-Kim Jong-un.

10
00:02:04,456 --> 00:02:06,725
We are talking
about Kim Jong-un.

11
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:08,260
Good evening.

12
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,162
I'm Dave Skylark.

13
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:13,766
Tonight, we are joined
by 13-time Grammy winner,

14
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:16,136
Oscar-winning songwriter,

15
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:18,570
Detroit's own Eminem.

16
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,140
He'll speak with us
about his new album,

17
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,842
which has been mired
in controversy

18
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:27,747
concerning lyrics that some view
as demeaning to the elderly.

19
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:29,549
Tonight...

20
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,283
on "Skylark Tonight."

21
00:02:39,824 --> 00:02:43,395
And... action.

22
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,764
"It's hell to be Shady.

23
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,332
"Yesterday I yelled
a degrading insult

24
00:02:47,432 --> 00:02:49,334
"at an elderly lady.

25
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:52,771
"Then I asked her
how it felt to be 80.

26
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:55,842
"'F' word a senior citizen.

27
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,411
Suck a wiener, sit and spin."

28
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,346
-(chuckling)
-"Suck a wiener, sit and spin."

29
00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:01,580
It's funny.

30
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,617
"And why you drive
so slow for?

31
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,386
"Don't you want to get
where you're going faster

32
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:10,455
"since you'll probably die
tomorrow, you old whore?

33
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:12,425
"Die, old bitch, die,

34
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,260
before I murder you."

35
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,196
What do you mean by this, Em?

36
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:18,230
Well, first of all,
I feel like, when I rap,

37
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,667
like, people twist my words.

38
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,368
Okay, but can you see

39
00:03:23,468 --> 00:03:26,271
how an old person
might say, "I think

40
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:30,510
"what this guy is telling me--
this Eminem-- is that I should

41
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,846
go kill myself, and I...
you know, I don't like that."

42
00:03:33,945 --> 00:03:36,348
I mean, I don't

43
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,819
necessarily rap about
the things that I hate.

44
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,422
It's more about...
the things that I fear.

45
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:44,623
-I get you.
-You know, it's like,

46
00:03:44,723 --> 00:03:47,693
-if I say something about women
or whatever... -Yes.

47
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,295
I think a lot of that
is more or less me

48
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,497
just dealing with issues with...

49
00:03:51,597 --> 00:03:53,533
you know, old issues
with my mom or whatever.

50
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:54,933
With your "mutha."

51
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:57,302
Yeah, or-or... you know,

52
00:03:57,402 --> 00:03:58,670
when I say things
about gay people

53
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,405
or people think that
my lyrics are homophobic,

54
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,474
-Mm-hmm.
-you know, it's because I'm gay.

55
00:04:02,574 --> 00:04:04,643
Um, when I rap
about violence

56
00:04:04,743 --> 00:04:07,413
-Wait... -or, you know, sound
like I'm promoting violence,

57
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,716
I think that, uh... you know,

58
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,651
-it's more or less because...
-What? -What, what, what?

59
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,786
you know, it's kind of...
it's kind of about me just,

60
00:04:13,885 --> 00:04:15,454
you know, confronting it.

61
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:16,923
-What did he just say?
-Wait, can we play that...?

62
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,658
-He said he was gay.
-Did he just...? Dave? Dave?

63
00:04:18,757 --> 00:04:19,992
-Did he just say he was gay?
-We're pretty sure

64
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,995
in the booth we just heard him
say he was gay.

65
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,431
Em, let's just...
back it up a moment.

66
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:28,401
You... just said

67
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,469
that you were gay?

68
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:33,605
Um... and I'm just curious

69
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,708
what you meant
by that exactly.

70
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:37,677
I mean I'm gay.

71
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:40,812
Uh, I'm just a little
confused here, because "gay"

72
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,415
can mean a lot of things.

73
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:43,815
I am a homosexual.

74
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:48,820
Meaning...?

75
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,889
I like men.

76
00:04:52,824 --> 00:04:54,593
What the fuck just happened?

77
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,596
Eminem just said
he was gay-- four times.

78
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,298
That's what the fuck
just happened.

79
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,432
-Holy shit.
-Holy shit.

80
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:00,699
Eminem's gay on our show.

81
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,701
-Eminem's gay on our show!
-Oh, my God!

82
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,304
-(phones ringing)
-Camera two! Camera two!

83
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:05,504
Gay Twitter!
Gay Twitter's blowing up.

84
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:06,872
-Holy shit.
-Change the chyron.

85
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,441
"Eminem Gay?!"
Question mark, exclamation mark.

86
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,043
Dave, keep him talking.
Keep him talking.

87
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,879
-Oh, my God. -Holy shit.
Push in on gay Eminem!

88
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:14,613
This is the greatest moment
in gay history!

89
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:17,916
...are probably shocked by what
you're saying right now.

90
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:20,853
I'm more shocked that people
haven't figured it out yet.

91
00:05:20,952 --> 00:05:23,455
I mean, it's kind of like
I've been playing gay peekaboo.

92
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:24,890
Gay peekaboo.

93
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,325
Yeah. But, um...

94
00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:27,659
AARON: Shit.
Camera one. Camera one.

95
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,329
-This interview is over.
Shut it off. -No!

96
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:30,896
-Shut it off. -Get the fuck
out of here, Darryl.

97
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,632
I am Marshall's publicist,
and I'm telling you,

98
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,033
-pull the fucking plug
right now. -No. This is gold.

99
00:05:34,132 --> 00:05:35,634
I am not cutting
this interview off.

100
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,002
This is the best interview
we've ever done.

101
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,638
-What happens if I just do this?
-No, get out.

102
00:05:38,737 --> 00:05:41,540
-(clamoring)
-Shut it off! Shut it off!

103
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,475
Get him out of here!
Get him the fuck out of here!

104
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:44,877
I will murder you
and everyone you love!

105
00:05:44,976 --> 00:05:47,045
Thank you.
Dave, look, I got the lyrics.

106
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,514
Say what I say:

107
00:05:48,613 --> 00:05:51,550
What did you mean
when you rapped...

108
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,752
"I said nice rectum, I had a..."

109
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,487
"...vasectomy, Hector.

110
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,757
"So you can't get pregnant

111
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,893
if I bisexually wreck ya."

112
00:06:00,992 --> 00:06:02,961
I've pretty much
just been leaving a...

113
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,831
bread-crumb trail of gayness.

114
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,665
-I see that now.
-You know.

115
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:07,900
But yeah, actually Hector...

116
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,769
Hector was a...
was a real person.

117
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,038
Hector and his rectum were real?

118
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:14,439
-Holy shit. -It's real!
Hector rectum is real!

119
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,777
-Yes! Yes! -Oh, I knew it!
-Slim Shady, everyone!

120
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:18,644
-(bell rings)
-AARON: Dude! Dude!

121
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:20,380
Aaron, bring it in.

122
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,448
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-Bring it in, big boy!

123
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,783
-(Dave laughing)
-Oh, my God...

124
00:06:23,882 --> 00:06:25,851
-Oh...!
-Oh, my God!

125
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:27,420
What the heck just happened?

126
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,854
The real Slim Shady
just stood up.

127
00:06:28,954 --> 00:06:30,522
-DAVE: Oh! -That's what the fuck
just happened.

128
00:06:30,622 --> 00:06:32,791
This is like Spike Lee
just said he's white.

129
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:34,127
I can't believe what's happened.

130
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:36,128
-You da man! You da man!
-You da man!

131
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:37,396
You're the best.

132
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:38,997
You're the best.
You're the best.

133
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,633
-Unreal. -All right, listen,
I'm gonna go get my makeup off.

134
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,834
I want you to meet me
downstairs.

135
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:43,102
I got something to show you.

136
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:45,404
AARON: Dude, just...
where are we going?

137
00:06:45,504 --> 00:06:47,406
I thought we were going to the
Hamptons for the weekend, man.

138
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:48,875
-No, no, no, no, no, no...
-What is this place?

139
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,811
We're just, you know...
just hanging out.

140
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,079
-Okay. -All right,
all right, all right.

141
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,947
It's a surprise party-- for you.

142
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,850
What? Why? Why did you
just tell me that?

143
00:06:57,949 --> 00:06:59,418
Yes! I...
'Cause I'm so excited.

144
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,420
This is gonna be great.
This is gonna be great.

145
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,687
I don't understand
what's happening.

146
00:07:02,788 --> 00:07:04,723
ALL:
Surprise!

147
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,158
All right, all right.
I already told him.

148
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,860
I already told him.
Come on, come on.

149
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,561
You're best in the world,
you fucking cocksucker.

150
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:11,430
All right, not now, Malcolm.
Not now, not now. Come on.

151
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,432
-Come on. -Thank you.
Why... why is this happening?

152
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,100
DAVE:
You've been with us

153
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,636
for 1,000 episodes.

154
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,771
-Are you kidding me?
-Ten years, baby!

155
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,138
-Are you fucking...
-Come on.

156
00:07:20,238 --> 00:07:22,174
I really do. It's, uh...
I appreciate it.

157
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:23,842
-DAVE: All right.
-AARON: Okay.

158
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:25,444
All right, now,

159
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:29,615
I know I like
to keep it light, keep it fun.

160
00:07:29,714 --> 00:07:32,617
I'm gonna take it
to a serious tip.

161
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:34,987
I'm gonna talk about Aaron.

162
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:37,456
Before we started
working together,

163
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,926
my show barely broke the top 15.

164
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,927
So I called up
this professor that worked

165
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,729
at the Columbia School
of Journalism that I...

166
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:45,598
I was having sex with,
and I said,

167
00:07:45,697 --> 00:07:49,067
"I need someone smarter
than anyone in entertainment.

168
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,137
I need a real journalist."

169
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:54,907
Aaron, you are
the Samwise Gamgee

170
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,043
to my Frodo Baggins.

171
00:07:57,142 --> 00:08:00,612
You are the Gandalf
to my Bilbo Baggins.

172
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:03,783
But of all the Lord of the Rings
references that I could make,

173
00:08:03,882 --> 00:08:05,150
this is the most important:

174
00:08:06,884 --> 00:08:09,622
-I'm Gollum...
-(mic feedback squeaks)

175
00:08:09,721 --> 00:08:12,224
...and you're my precious.

176
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:15,894
Smeagol needs Aaron.

177
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,896
"One Ring to rule them all,

178
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,500
and in the darkness
bind them."

179
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,236
Now, get up here!
Get up here!

180
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,705
-Come up here, buddy.
I love you. -Okay. Okay. Okay.

181
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,673
-I fucking love you.
-Oh...

182
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:31,843
(laughing)

183
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,778
Hey.

184
00:08:34,812 --> 00:08:36,048
Hey!

185
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,050
(chuckling):
Hey.

186
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:40,819
Yeah. Like, what's that?

187
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,920
Come on, man.
What's happening?

188
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,655
-Hey, yeah.
-Hey, yeah.

189
00:08:43,755 --> 00:08:45,190
-Wh-What's happening?
-How's it going, dude?

190
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,927
We haven't seen each other
since graduation, right?

191
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,129
-Yeah. Probably.
-Wow. And, uh...

192
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,198
Wait. Am I wrong?
Are you, like, a...

193
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,533
you're a junior producer
on "60 Minutes," right?

194
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:55,768
I'm now a senior producer.

195
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,169
-No way, man.
-Yeah. Yeah.

196
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:58,703
-That's awesome.
-Thank you.

197
00:08:58,803 --> 00:09:01,841
Look at us-- both producing news
for television.

198
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,009
(chuckling):
Yeah.

199
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,677
-What was that?
-Nothing.

200
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,846
It was clearly something.
What's the joke?

201
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,548
No, I mean, like,
you've got your job,

202
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,116
I got mine, but they're
different, you know?

203
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:12,585
Yours is cool; mine's just

204
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:13,952
a little bit more serious,
you know?

205
00:09:14,052 --> 00:09:16,121
What are you saying?
We have the same job.

206
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:19,257
I report real news--
you know, stuff that matters--

207
00:09:19,357 --> 00:09:21,626
and then you report
on all the cool

208
00:09:21,726 --> 00:09:22,727
"who's getting new boobs"
and, like,

209
00:09:22,827 --> 00:09:24,262
the fun eating disorder stuff.

210
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,132
You really helped build up
"60 Minutes," too, right?

211
00:09:26,231 --> 00:09:27,766
They'd be nothing without you.

212
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:29,267
It's only been on
for 80 fucking years.

213
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:30,836
Look, I... I'm sorry.

214
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:32,238
I'm sorry-- look...
I shouldn't say this,

215
00:09:32,337 --> 00:09:34,173
but we got an opening
over at "60 Minutes,"

216
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,142
and we could use
somebody like you.

217
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:37,776
Are you serious?

218
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:39,578
I'm fucking with you, man.
Come on! You?

219
00:09:39,678 --> 00:09:41,780
At where I work? You'd be
eaten alive at our office.

220
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,716
Okay, I'm gonna catch up
with these guys,

221
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:44,917
but cheers, man.

222
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,153
Congrats... or whatever.

223
00:09:51,722 --> 00:09:53,725
When did the hair begin to go?

224
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,226
-I would say...
-(Aaron sighs)

225
00:09:55,326 --> 00:09:56,928
around "The Outsiders."

226
00:10:00,264 --> 00:10:02,999
When you're ready.

227
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,004
I don't think I'll ever
be ready, but...

228
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,139
-Oh, wig's coming off.
-Oh.

229
00:10:12,677 --> 00:10:14,080
Whoa.

230
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:15,747
Oh, Jesus fuck.

231
00:10:15,847 --> 00:10:17,750
Why does he keep
the long pieces?

232
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,619
His head looks like
somebody's taint.

233
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,887
-You barely look different.
-Thanks, man.

234
00:10:21,986 --> 00:10:23,622
You... you said you were bald.

235
00:10:23,722 --> 00:10:25,290
I... I see a little stuff
on top.

236
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,158
-It's so freeing!
-Rob...

237
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:32,031
is there anything that you would
like to say to America?

238
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:35,100
(Lowe sighs)

239
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:37,936
Good evening.

240
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:38,971
I'm Phillip Sterling

241
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:40,940
with a UBS News Special Report.

242
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:42,173
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

243
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,875
Kim Jong-un's military forces

244
00:10:43,975 --> 00:10:46,312
targeted an uninhabited
South Pacific island

245
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:49,315
with a 15-megaton
thermonuclear ICBM.

246
00:10:49,414 --> 00:10:50,949
Yo, Dave, we're not
live anymore.

247
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:52,851
-They just cut our feed.
-We're off the air?

248
00:10:52,951 --> 00:10:55,888
Goddamn it! Rob, would you just
put your fucking wig on?

249
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,657
They fucked us! Goddamn it!

250
00:10:57,756 --> 00:10:59,190
Somebody tell me
what's going on?

251
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:03,729
DAVE: Dude... seriously,
what is up with you?

252
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:06,064
You know how I'm good
at picking up energies?

253
00:11:06,164 --> 00:11:08,800
Well, you're shooting off a
slightly cunty vibe right now.

254
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,368
What's going on?

255
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,004
We have millions
of viewers every night

256
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,739
watching our show,
and what do we do?

257
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,274
We just shovel shit
into their faces, man.

258
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,076
We could be doing
something positive.

259
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,980
We could be having on authors,
activists, politicians.

260
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,982
That's what people want.
"Give us some shit.

261
00:11:23,081 --> 00:11:24,817
"Mangia. We're the people.
Give us the shit.

262
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,686
Mangia, mangia, mangia."

263
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:30,221
Dude, I wanted to cover actual
news, not Nicki Minaj's vagina

264
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:31,691
fuckin' flopping out
at the Grammys.

265
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,992
You don't like
that brown sugar?

266
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:34,693
Nothing to do
with brown sugar.

267
00:11:34,793 --> 00:11:36,127
I just can't keep
doing this, okay?

268
00:11:36,227 --> 00:11:37,328
We have to change.

269
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:42,967
-Fine.
-Are you serious right now?

270
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:44,937
-Yeah.
-Do you promise you'll do this?

271
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:48,107
I promise if you promise
you'll never leave.

272
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:49,774
If you promise,
then I'll promise.

273
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,309
-Well, then, same time.
-One, two, three.

274
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:52,410
-Promise.
-Promise.

275
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,445
-Okay.
-Okay.

276
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,947
That's all we had to say.

277
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,449
-Fine.
-Don't put me through that.

278
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:59,150
-Okay.
-I hate it when we fight.

279
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,386
No, this is not a joke, okay?

280
00:12:01,486 --> 00:12:03,154
Well, I think you're being
kind of condescending.

281
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:04,423
-Look! Look, look, look...
-What? Yeah... one second.

282
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:06,158
Shut up. I'm on the phone.

283
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:07,893
-Okay? Uh...
-(glass shatters)

284
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,996
Dude, what the fuck, man?
That was John Kerry's office.

285
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:12,264
Forget that
oak-tree-looking fuck.

286
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:14,399
This tops it.
"The Times" printed it

287
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,869
about... about North Korea.
Read the bottom.

288
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:19,472
After all the...
the death camp shit.

289
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,373
"Although Kim Jong-un
rallies his people

290
00:12:21,472 --> 00:12:23,274
"with cries for the destruction

291
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,443
"of the United States
of America, he is known

292
00:12:25,543 --> 00:12:28,213
"to be an avid consumer
of American entertainment.

293
00:12:28,313 --> 00:12:31,149
His favorite shows
are 'The Big Bang Theory...'"

294
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,085
And...?

295
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:35,453
"...and 'Skylark Tonight.'"

296
00:12:35,553 --> 00:12:37,222
Oh! Boom!

297
00:12:37,322 --> 00:12:39,091
(imitates explosion)

298
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,392
This is great!

299
00:12:40,491 --> 00:12:42,227
This is what you
were talking about.

300
00:12:42,327 --> 00:12:44,329
I interview this guy.

301
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:45,997
Are you joking me, man?
He's the most

302
00:12:46,097 --> 00:12:47,198
reclusive leader on the planet.

303
00:12:47,298 --> 00:12:48,800
It's not gonna happen.

304
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,769
He lives in North Korea.
We can't go there.

305
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,905
Dave Skylark...
gets in anywhere.

306
00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:55,807
You remember that club?

307
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,176
Three-month waiting list.

308
00:12:57,275 --> 00:12:58,843
(grunts) First night.

309
00:12:58,943 --> 00:13:01,045
I don't think it's
quite the same thing.

310
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:03,181
Well, there were a lot
of Asian girls there.

311
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,450
It's impossible, Dave.

312
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:05,817
Here's what we're gonna do.

313
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,418
We're gonna do that interview,

314
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,023
everyone is gonna take you
super-duper seriously,

315
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,526
and then you're never
gonna leave me.

316
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,461
North Korea's
in the Olympics, right?

317
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,495
I bet they have
an office that is

318
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,197
set up to communicate
with the Olympic Committee,

319
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,432
so there's probably

320
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:22,368
some infrastructure
for communicating with

321
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:24,068
the outside world
through that.

322
00:13:24,168 --> 00:13:25,804
Good idea.
Those wheels are turning.

323
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:27,472
-If I leave a message
for that office... -Yeah.

324
00:13:27,572 --> 00:13:29,341
-then maybe, if they're
a fan of the show, -Mm-hmm.

325
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,143
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-that can actually work.

326
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,212
-We could interview the most
famous man on the planet. -Yeah.

327
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,947
-That would be the biggest
interview ever. -Yeah...

328
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,481
Guys, guys, guys, guys!
I don't know if you've

329
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:38,250
heard this, but some
pictures just came out

330
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,884
where it looks like
McConaughey's fucking a goat.

331
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,221
-Whoa. "McConaughey Goat Fuck"?
-Ew...

332
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,956
McConaughey Goat Fuck.

333
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,391
-AARON: Uh...
-(Dave whimpers)

334
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,026
Okay, we obviously have
to have him on to do that,

335
00:13:48,126 --> 00:13:49,460
so... we should
put that together.

336
00:13:49,561 --> 00:13:51,363
But we're doing this
North Korea thing, okay?

337
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:53,264
-First thing tomorrow. Okay.
-Book him, though. Book him.

338
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,000
-Get him, get him, get him!
Get the goat! -I'm on him.

339
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,836
Get the goat!

340
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,838
I got some questions
for that goat.

341
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:04,844
(phone line ringing,
answering machine beeps)

342
00:14:04,943 --> 00:14:07,378
Hello. This is Aaron Rapoport
from "Skylark Tonight."

343
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,281
We heard your Supreme Leader
is a big fan

344
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,382
of our show, and we'd love
to have him on.

345
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:14,018
Uh, please get back to me
and let me know.

346
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,154
I'm about to head
to an important meeting,

347
00:14:16,254 --> 00:14:17,990
but, uh, I'll be around
in the morning.

348
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,325
-Hope to hear from you.
-(beep)

349
00:14:19,424 --> 00:14:22,060
Ooh! Yeah.

350
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,562
-Hi.
-Hey.

351
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:27,566
Uh, Mercer and Spring, please.

352
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,568
Whoo!

353
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,570
(phone ringing)

354
00:14:36,674 --> 00:14:38,043
Hello?

355
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,445
Hello. Who dis?

356
00:14:39,544 --> 00:14:41,279
MAN: I am trying
to reach Aaron Rapoport.

357
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:42,615
You got Aaron Rapoport.

358
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,884
-Who dis is?
-You left word

359
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,118
with our office
regarding an interview.

360
00:14:46,217 --> 00:14:47,586
AARON:
Look, Dave, is this you?

361
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,054
'Cause if it is,

362
00:14:49,153 --> 00:14:51,423
you're doing
a terrible Asian accent.

363
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:52,957
Me so "solly."

364
00:14:53,057 --> 00:14:55,126
Me gots to go now, son.

365
00:14:55,226 --> 00:14:57,096
I am from the office
of Sook-yin Park,

366
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,898
Secretary of Communications

367
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,066
with the Democratic People's
Republic of North Korea.

368
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,035
Oh, my God. Uh...

369
00:15:03,134 --> 00:15:04,636
Shit. Uh, me so solly.

370
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:06,905
I mean, I'm so solly.
I mean, I-I'm so sor...

371
00:15:07,005 --> 00:15:09,975
I'm-I'm... I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

372
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,645
MAN: We would like to discuss
the possibility of a meeting

373
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,047
between the Supreme Leader
and Dave Skylark.

374
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:16,248
Security concerns dictate

375
00:15:16,347 --> 00:15:18,449
that the matter
be discussed in person.

376
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:21,085
Uh, okay, great.
Where... where do you do that?

377
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:24,490
We will meet
at latitude 40.1326,

378
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,393
longitude 123.9889.

379
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,228
Just 'cause I'm not, like,
totally familiar

380
00:15:29,327 --> 00:15:30,495
with my longitudes
and latitudes,

381
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,197
where is that again?

382
00:15:32,297 --> 00:15:35,634
50 kilometers west of Dandong,
northeastern China.

383
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,469
Did you just say "China"?

384
00:15:37,568 --> 00:15:39,471
And did you just say "dong"?

385
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,275
(sighs)

386
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,312
(chuckles quietly)

387
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,314
Going to motherfucking
China, y'all.

388
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:53,252
♪ ♪

389
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:05,663
(whistle blows)

390
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,365
Excuse me,
can I get in there?

391
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,134
Thank you.

392
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:10,602
Hi, there.

393
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:12,270
(speaking Mandarin)

394
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,206
No, thank you.

395
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,442
I'll just get it
through secondhand smoke.

396
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:21,412
Selfie!

397
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:22,447
(laughter)

398
00:16:37,562 --> 00:16:39,565
(panting)

399
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:44,302
(GPS blipping steadily)

400
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:49,708
(three rapid beeps)

401
00:16:49,807 --> 00:16:51,442
Well, where the fuck are they?

402
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:54,379
What the fuck?

403
00:16:58,515 --> 00:17:00,519
(helicopter approaching)

404
00:17:09,193 --> 00:17:10,428
No, no!

405
00:17:25,442 --> 00:17:28,646
(shouting in Korean)

406
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,115
No! No!

407
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:31,750
I'm an American journalist!

408
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:32,817
Aaron Rapoport!

409
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:33,818
I was invited here!

410
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,254
(shouting in Korean)

411
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:36,555
I come in peace!

412
00:17:36,654 --> 00:17:37,689
I'm here for interview!

413
00:17:37,788 --> 00:17:41,359
Please don't kill me!

414
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:56,508
Mr. Rapoport,
I am Sook-yin Park.

415
00:17:56,607 --> 00:17:59,077
The Supreme Leader will grant
a one-hour interview

416
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,380
to Mr. Skylark
from inside North Korea.

417
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,316
All questions will be supplied
by the Supreme Leader himself.

418
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:07,653
Terms are nonnegotiable.
You have 24 hours to decide.

419
00:18:07,752 --> 00:18:10,655
-That's it?
-Yes.

420
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,724
Why didn't you guys tell me this
over the phone?

421
00:18:12,824 --> 00:18:14,660
Or Skype?
Do you guys have Skype?

422
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:16,528
Do you have Skype here?
Okay.

423
00:18:16,627 --> 00:18:18,429
Well, look, can you give me
some water?

424
00:18:18,529 --> 00:18:20,398
That guy has water!

425
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,500
Please give me a ride somewhere!

426
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,536
I didn't pack well
for this trip!

427
00:18:24,635 --> 00:18:26,404
I packed like a fool!

428
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,740
Like a goddamn fool!

429
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:31,809
Please! Please!

430
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,146
Whoa.

431
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:40,818
(groaning)

432
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,821
(sighs)

433
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,823
(groaning)

434
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,428
Damn, she was sexy.

435
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,829
The fucking helicopter landed.

436
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,465
I'm in the middle of nowhere.

437
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,134
Two soldiers jump out.

438
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:56,300
I think I'm gonna get killed.

439
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:58,737
Then, out comes Sook.

440
00:18:58,836 --> 00:18:59,738
I told you about her.

441
00:18:59,837 --> 00:19:01,373
She comes out of the helicopter.

442
00:19:01,472 --> 00:19:03,241
-She's hot, super sexy.
-How hot?

443
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,910
-Did you get in there? -Yeah,
I fucked her in the helicopter.

444
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:06,310
My fucking man!

445
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,881
No, I didn't do that, dude.
No!

446
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,781
-Okay. -She said we couldn't ask
any of our own questions.

447
00:19:10,882 --> 00:19:13,185
They were gonna write
all the questions.

448
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,319
We can't do it.

449
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:15,586
We're essentially letting him

450
00:19:15,686 --> 00:19:18,156
interview himself
with your mouth.

451
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,458
Look!

452
00:19:19,557 --> 00:19:20,625
Look at this buttfuck!

453
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,861
He's got a whole parade
of nukes.

454
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,229
He's ready to use them.

455
00:19:24,328 --> 00:19:26,397
When you score a bin Laden

456
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,401
or a Hitler or an Un,

457
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,869
you take it by the balls!

458
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,605
It's the first rule
of journalism.

459
00:19:33,704 --> 00:19:35,606
You give the people
what they want.

460
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:36,909
That's not the first rule
of journalism.

461
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,277
I think that's
the first rule of,

462
00:19:38,376 --> 00:19:39,778
like, circuses
and demolition derbies.

463
00:19:39,877 --> 00:19:42,880
This is the biggest interview
since Frosty Nixon.

464
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,883
-Frosty Nixon?
-I mean, in ten years,

465
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:47,251
Ron Howard's gonna make
a movie out of this.

466
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,487
We do this, we can interview

467
00:19:48,586 --> 00:19:51,390
any president on the planet.

468
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,192
And then you can ask them
the real questions.

469
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:57,361
This is like
eating our vegetables.

470
00:19:57,461 --> 00:19:58,596
Once you eat those,

471
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:00,398
then you get to eat the steak.

472
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,500
And we know Aaron
wants his steak.

473
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:05,370
This is like...

474
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,505
"The Lord of the Rings."

475
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,272
Okay?

476
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:11,710
I'm actually like Frodo Baggins.

477
00:20:13,644 --> 00:20:16,682
(gently):
And you are my Sam.

478
00:20:16,781 --> 00:20:17,949
My Samwise.

479
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:19,917
I can't do it without you.

480
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,653
-Okay.
-Come with me.

481
00:20:21,752 --> 00:20:23,288
To Mordor.

482
00:20:23,387 --> 00:20:24,956
Okay, let's fucking do it.

483
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,692
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

484
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,830
As always,
I'd like to thank my guest,

485
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,466
Joe Gordon-Levitt.

486
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,733
And before we go,

487
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:38,570
I have
a very special announcement.

488
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,807
With the help
of my outstanding producer,

489
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:44,809
Aaron Rapoport, I've secured
the most important interview

490
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,246
of the 21st century.

491
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,280
Three weeks from tonight,

492
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,351
I will be traveling
to Pyongyang, North Korea,

493
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:56,355
to conduct the first
globally broadcast interview

494
00:20:56,454 --> 00:20:58,423
with President Kim Jong-un.

495
00:20:58,522 --> 00:21:01,859
I am deeply humbled
and profoundly honored

496
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,430
to accept this
most awesome responsibility.

497
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:07,865
Apparently, Dave Skylark
will be interviewing

498
00:21:07,965 --> 00:21:09,834
the dictator of North Korea.

499
00:21:09,934 --> 00:21:11,903
100 bucks Skylark thinks

500
00:21:12,002 --> 00:21:13,838
he's the guy
from "Gangnam Style."

501
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,608
Obscene glorification
of a brutal dictator.

502
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,442
This is a man who tortures,

503
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:20,678
terrorizes and starves
his own people.

504
00:21:20,778 --> 00:21:23,448
-Skylark is beneath despicable.
-Fuck this.

505
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,517
Meeee-ow.

506
00:21:25,616 --> 00:21:28,052
What a fucking bitch,
am I right? (chuckles)

507
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,721
No, you're not right.

508
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,722
He's not being a bitch.
He's completely right.

509
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:35,527
He's motherfucking
peanut butter and jealous.

510
00:21:35,626 --> 00:21:37,028
-He's not jealous.
-He's putting

511
00:21:37,128 --> 00:21:39,030
KY jealous all over his dick.

512
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,033
What is there to be jealous of?

513
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,067
Fuckers hate us
'cause they ain't us.

514
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:44,735
They hates us 'cause we "anus"?

515
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,704
What the fuck does an anus
have to do with this?

516
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,074
They hate us
'cause they ain't us.

517
00:21:49,173 --> 00:21:50,808
That's not what it is.

518
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,344
-Yes, it is.
-No, it's not.

519
00:21:52,443 --> 00:21:53,711
They hate us 'cause we is us,

520
00:21:53,811 --> 00:21:55,813
and what we is doing
is fucking terrible.

521
00:21:55,913 --> 00:21:57,715
They fucking hate us
'cause they ain't us.

522
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,750
-Stop saying that. They don't
-Hate us 'cause they ain't us.

523
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,820
-hate us 'cause they ain't us!
-Hate us 'cause they ain't us!

524
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,689
-They don't hate us 'cause they
ain't us. -I'm used to it.

525
00:22:03,788 --> 00:22:05,723
-Hate us 'cause they ain't us.
-Stop it. Stop it.

526
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,060
-Don't say it again.
-Shh.

527
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,661
Baby.

528
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,629
Haters gonna hate.

529
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,931
(sighs)

530
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,566
And ain't-ers gonna ain't.

531
00:22:14,665 --> 00:22:17,068
That is not an actual thing
people say.

532
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,937
This is what you do to haters.

533
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:21,840
You just smile.

534
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,075
(spluttering)

535
00:22:23,174 --> 00:22:24,842
(smacking lips)

536
00:22:24,942 --> 00:22:26,377
(jabbers goofily)

537
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:27,913
(gulps)

538
00:22:28,012 --> 00:22:29,947
What is that?

539
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:32,951
The strongest ecstasy
I've ever done in my life.

540
00:22:43,693 --> 00:22:45,696
(snoring)

541
00:22:51,935 --> 00:22:53,471
(knocking)

542
00:22:53,571 --> 00:22:55,005
(groans):
Oh...

543
00:22:55,105 --> 00:22:57,075
Oh, what the fuck?

544
00:22:57,174 --> 00:22:58,676
(knocking continues)

545
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:00,379
Okay.

546
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:01,546
(coughing)

547
00:23:01,645 --> 00:23:02,748
Okay, I'm coming.

548
00:23:08,452 --> 00:23:09,954
Oh, shit.

549
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,690
(knocking continues)

550
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:13,557
Oh... oh, God.

551
00:23:16,093 --> 00:23:17,429
Mr. Rapoport.

552
00:23:17,528 --> 00:23:18,896
I'm Agent Lacey

553
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,132
with Central Intelligence,

554
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:21,700
and this is my partner,
Agent Botwin.

555
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:23,601
DAVE:
Aaron, whoever that is,

556
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:24,869
tell them to fuck off.

557
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,704
Dave, it's, uh,

558
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:29,841
-it's not... -Yo, I don't know
who I fucked last night,

559
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:32,177
but I got some stink dick.

560
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:35,180
Yo, my dick stinks!

561
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:37,782
So weird how you, like,

562
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,050
just want to keep
smelling it, though.

563
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:42,487
Yo, you got to come over
and smell this shit.

564
00:23:42,586 --> 00:23:43,721
Yo, come smell this.

565
00:23:43,821 --> 00:23:44,855
You got to identify this.

566
00:23:44,955 --> 00:23:46,057
I don't know what it is.

567
00:23:46,156 --> 00:23:47,826
Excuse him.

568
00:23:47,925 --> 00:23:49,160
He has stink dick.
(chuckles)

569
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,430
It kind of smells
like guacamole.

570
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:53,131
May we come in?

571
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,433
Would you, um,

572
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:58,603
like a drink or some
of Aaron's cocaine?

573
00:23:58,702 --> 00:24:00,638
This is not our cocaine.
This is...

574
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,073
LACEY:
No, I'm sure it's not.

575
00:24:02,173 --> 00:24:05,509
So, uh, how can we, uh,
what can we do you for?

576
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:07,144
-Yeah, to what do we owe
the pleasure? -AARON: Yeah.

577
00:24:07,244 --> 00:24:08,679
Well, Aaron, Dave,

578
00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:09,847
as I'm sure

579
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,615
you know already,

580
00:24:11,715 --> 00:24:12,883
Kim Jong-un is now capable

581
00:24:12,983 --> 00:24:16,187
of nuking all of
the West Coast.

582
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,789
The point is we're talking
about nuclear nations

583
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,792
at war with each other.

584
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:22,160
Nuclear.

585
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:23,561
He does have one

586
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,896
tactical advantage
over the West.

587
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,900
He's more than willing
to let millions and millions

588
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,469
of his own people die.

589
00:24:30,568 --> 00:24:33,704
Ba-bam. Explosions.
All over my face.

590
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,907
I'm sorry, we had kind
of a long night last night.

591
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:37,075
Why are you telling us

592
00:24:37,174 --> 00:24:38,976
-all this information?
-Well,

593
00:24:39,076 --> 00:24:41,980
well, we're telling you this
because you two lucky gentlemen

594
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:43,914
are going to be in a room alone
with him,

595
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,484
and congratulations, by the way.

596
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:46,918
That's right!

597
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:48,653
Which is part of the reason
why we're here.

598
00:24:48,752 --> 00:24:50,187
The CIA would love it

599
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:52,557
if you two could...

600
00:24:52,656 --> 00:24:54,558
take him out.

601
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:57,796
Hmm?

602
00:24:57,895 --> 00:24:59,530
-Take him out.
-Take him out?

603
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,199
-Like, for drinks?
-No, no, no.

604
00:25:01,298 --> 00:25:03,067
-Take him out.
-Take out.

605
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:04,902
-Like, to dinner?
-Take him out to a meal?

606
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:06,203
Take him out.

607
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,906
-Like, on the town?
-Party?

608
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,908
No, uh...

609
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,076
take him out.

610
00:25:12,176 --> 00:25:15,746
You want us to assassinate
the leader of North Korea?

611
00:25:15,846 --> 00:25:18,682
-Yes.
-What...?!

612
00:25:18,782 --> 00:25:20,117
If we kill him,
won't they just get

613
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:21,686
another chubby dude
with a goofy hairdo

614
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:23,121
to come in and replace him?

615
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:25,757
-Exactly, exactly. -And then
the same thing happens?

616
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:27,625
Uh, actually,
we're aware of a small faction

617
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:30,095
in the existing leadership
that already wants him gone.

618
00:25:30,194 --> 00:25:32,596
They want change; they're
too scared to act alone,

619
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:33,998
and they need you two
to go in there...

620
00:25:34,098 --> 00:25:35,266
Hmm...

621
00:25:35,366 --> 00:25:39,136
remove Kim,
embolden them to revolt

622
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:41,105
and take over.

623
00:25:41,205 --> 00:25:44,542
Are you, Agent Lacey,
going to be involved?

624
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,645
I am going to be in your ear,

625
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:51,115
by your side,
every step of the way.

626
00:25:51,215 --> 00:25:53,984
Then I have one answer.

627
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,921
No more Kim.

628
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,755
AARON:
Uh, you know what?

629
00:25:57,855 --> 00:25:59,057
Actually, I think we should
talk about it more.

630
00:25:59,156 --> 00:26:00,791
-Okay, all right.
-Okay, let's just...

631
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:01,860
-We're just gonna talk.
-We're just gonna talk.

632
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,894
By all means.

633
00:26:02,993 --> 00:26:03,894
Just for the record,

634
00:26:03,994 --> 00:26:05,996
I don't have stink dick.

635
00:26:06,096 --> 00:26:08,333
DAVE: Come over here, come here,
come in here...

636
00:26:08,432 --> 00:26:11,135
I think we need to do this.

637
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,672
She is so cool.

638
00:26:13,771 --> 00:26:15,807
You don't see what's happening,
and it's so obvious.

639
00:26:15,906 --> 00:26:16,907
-It's crazy, man.
-What?

640
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:18,677
They're honeypotting us.

641
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:19,811
-What?
-It's an attractive

642
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,278
spy woman who lures men

643
00:26:21,378 --> 00:26:22,780
into doing shit they're
not supposed to do.

644
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,015
How can you not see that?

645
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,750
-Because that is so sexist.
-Is it?

646
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:27,786
-This is 2014.
-Dude...

647
00:26:27,885 --> 00:26:29,220
Women are smart now.

648
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:31,088
Do you actually think
she just so happens

649
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,990
to have everything
you find attractive?

650
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,826
Bangs, giant tits, glasses?

651
00:26:35,926 --> 00:26:36,894
They're fake, man.

652
00:26:36,994 --> 00:26:38,295
Fake glasses?

653
00:26:38,395 --> 00:26:40,164
How could the CIA come up
with such a thing?

654
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,932
Well, that poor girl
is blind as a bat.

655
00:26:42,032 --> 00:26:44,802
Okay, I'm just saying that
when we're on Molly

656
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,337
and when we're horned up
might not be...

657
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,339
-Horned up?
-You are horned up.

658
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,840
Oh, please!

659
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,043
You got half a fucking
chub right now!

660
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:53,812
-Take your hands away.
-Hmm-mm.

661
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,313
-I saw the boner.
-I'm not taking my hands away.

662
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:56,981
Move your fucking hands.

663
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:58,216
Fine, you want to see it?

664
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,018
-Yeah.
-Feast your eyes.

665
00:27:00,117 --> 00:27:01,086
Okay, here's what's
gonna happen.

666
00:27:01,185 --> 00:27:02,386
I'm gonna poop out these drugs.

667
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:03,688
You're gonna go jerk off
these thoughts.

668
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,323
If we both still want to talk

669
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,959
about this afterwards, then
we can, but not until then.

670
00:27:08,058 --> 00:27:11,028
Dave Skylark never backs down
from a jerk-off.

671
00:27:13,396 --> 00:27:15,700
LACEY (voice-over):
In three days,

672
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:17,868
you will fly from New York
to Beijing,

673
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,238
where you will transfer
to a commercial airline

674
00:27:20,337 --> 00:27:22,641
that takes you directly
to Pyongyang.

675
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,142
I'm sorry,
this is completely unrelated,

676
00:27:24,241 --> 00:27:27,645
but, um, what happened
to your glasses?

677
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,816
Oh, I... I got LASIK.

678
00:27:31,915 --> 00:27:33,350
Between the time
I saw you and now?

679
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,854
-Yes.
-Okay.

680
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:37,989
Now, our intelligence suggests
that you will be taken here,

681
00:27:38,088 --> 00:27:40,958
to Kim Jong-un's
personal compound.

682
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:43,293
So, preceding the interview,

683
00:27:43,394 --> 00:27:45,363
you are going
to shake Kim's hand,

684
00:27:45,462 --> 00:27:48,832
administering
a fatal dose of poison

685
00:27:48,932 --> 00:27:51,403
with this, a transdermal
time-delayed

686
00:27:51,502 --> 00:27:52,903
ricin strip.

687
00:27:53,003 --> 00:27:54,371
When you shake his hand,

688
00:27:54,471 --> 00:27:57,741
the poison will be absorbed
into his skin,

689
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,745
where it metabolizes
for a 12-hour period.

690
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,748
Nobody will have any idea
you two were involved.

691
00:28:03,847 --> 00:28:05,383
No one will know?

692
00:28:05,482 --> 00:28:09,788
The United States must maintain
total and complete deniability.

693
00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:12,122
-Total deniability?
-Obviously.

694
00:28:12,222 --> 00:28:13,857
-This isn't what I pictured.
-What did you picture?

695
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,759
I walk in there
like a fucking gangster

696
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:17,928
and blow
his little fucking ass away

697
00:28:18,028 --> 00:28:19,263
on television.

698
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,400
This is a major
television event.

699
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,103
You don't want to blow it
with offscreen death.

700
00:28:25,202 --> 00:28:27,004
Okay?

701
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:30,741
Look, in porno, we call
this the money shot.

702
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,711
You don't have a bunch of dudes
going at it,

703
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:35,413
and then right before
they finish, you cut to black

704
00:28:35,512 --> 00:28:36,947
and say, "Oh, don't worry,

705
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,017
12 hours later,
they came all over each other."

706
00:28:39,116 --> 00:28:40,918
No! We want

707
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,287
the all-over close-up.

708
00:28:42,386 --> 00:28:43,153
All over his face.

709
00:28:43,253 --> 00:28:45,490
The end!

710
00:28:45,589 --> 00:28:47,357
Ah...

711
00:28:48,358 --> 00:28:49,827
Bam!

712
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,062
What kind of porn
are you watching?

713
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:52,430
What happens when
all of his guards

714
00:28:52,529 --> 00:28:54,732
start firing back at you
for killing their leader

715
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,167
right in front of them?

716
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:58,036
-That's a good question.
-My bulletproof vest...

717
00:28:58,135 --> 00:29:00,238
No, you don't have
a bulletproof vest.

718
00:29:00,337 --> 00:29:02,840
-You don't have one of those.
-I will dodge those bullets.

719
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:04,976
What happens after you escape
the compound, Dave?

720
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,344
I look back over my shoulder.

721
00:29:06,443 --> 00:29:08,245
I see Aaron.
I grab him by the hand.

722
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:09,847
We run out into the woods.

723
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:12,817
Perhaps there's
a secret tunnel there.

724
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:14,318
We exit said tunnel.

725
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,455
At a designated spot,
SEAL Team Six

726
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,923
swoops in, puts us on one

727
00:29:20,023 --> 00:29:22,793
of those inflatable motorboats,
we hit the water,

728
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:25,163
we're out of there,
on our way to you.

729
00:29:25,262 --> 00:29:27,765
If you did try to do this,
what would kill you first?

730
00:29:27,865 --> 00:29:28,833
Sub-freezing temperatures.

731
00:29:28,932 --> 00:29:30,201
I don't like the cold.

732
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,003
-Okay, we...
-Starvation, starve to death.

733
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,806
You telling me the CIA
doesn't have

734
00:29:34,905 --> 00:29:36,941
North Face jackets
and some Pirate Booty?

735
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,475
Cap'n Crunch?

736
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:39,943
What about Siberian tigers?

737
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:41,980
-Did you think about that?
-What?

738
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:43,380
You're not going to shoot him.

739
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,848
There's not going to be
a bulletproof vest,

740
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,351
and nobody
is going to know

741
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,252
that you had anything
to do with this.

742
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:50,121
That's it, that's the plan.

743
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:51,288
-Period.
-DAVE: Okay.

744
00:29:51,388 --> 00:29:52,890
Two years later,

745
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,992
I come out
with my bestselling tell-all.

746
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:56,361
"An Unexpected Journey:

747
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,497
Dave Skylark's Adventures
in North Korea."

748
00:29:59,596 --> 00:30:01,132
You can't write a tell-all.

749
00:30:01,231 --> 00:30:02,901
"We were an oddly-shaped
gray room

750
00:30:03,999 --> 00:30:04,868
"at the CIA headquarters.

751
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,004
The titillating Agent Lacey..."

752
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:07,238
Stop doing that.

753
00:30:07,337 --> 00:30:08,972
-Why?
-There's no tell-all.

754
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:11,242
"'There's no tell-all,'
Agent Lacey said.

755
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,044
"She looked at him.

756
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:16,447
She trembled with rage,
or was it passion?"

757
00:30:16,547 --> 00:30:18,850
-Stop it.
-I just want everybody to know

758
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,152
that I know
what you did to me

759
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:23,221
-With the glasses?
-What?

760
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,423
-Honeycombed me.
-What does that even mean?

761
00:30:25,522 --> 00:30:27,192
You honeypotted him.
It's honeypot.

762
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:28,992
-You honeypotted me.
-You honeypotted him.

763
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:30,829
-No, I didn't. -He's said
a lot of stupid shit

764
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,063
in the last ten minutes,
but for reals,

765
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,530
you did honeypot him.

766
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:35,567
I bet you got him in here
as a honey dick

767
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:37,301
just in case I'm gay,
but I'm not,

768
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,136
but if I was, I would've
seen him coming a mile away.

769
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,538
-You honey dicking? -Look, she's
not honeypotting you,

770
00:30:41,638 --> 00:30:43,540
-and I'm not honey dicking him.
-It's very offensive,

771
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,543
'cause basically if you think
about what you're saying to me,

772
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:47,010
you're saying
because I'm a girl,

773
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:48,880
and because I'm attractive,

774
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,016
my only use for this agency
would be to manipulate men.

775
00:30:52,115 --> 00:30:53,417
I think it's offensive, too.

776
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,019
and that's exactly
what I said to Aaron.

777
00:30:55,118 --> 00:30:56,920
I said that bitch
is blind as a bat.

778
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,423
Can we please move on?

779
00:30:58,522 --> 00:31:01,091
We have a dictator to kill.

780
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,228
When handling the ricin strip,

781
00:31:03,327 --> 00:31:05,596
operate with extreme caution.

782
00:31:05,696 --> 00:31:08,498
Even momentary flesh contact
with the exposed strip is fatal.

783
00:31:08,598 --> 00:31:11,568
The poison will lay dormant
for 12 hours.

784
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,638
After it passes
the blood-brain barrier,

785
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:16,374
your heart rate
would shoot up to 160.

786
00:31:16,473 --> 00:31:18,342
Your body will strain
to reject the poison

787
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:20,577
by profusely sweating,
defecating, vomiting.

788
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:21,913
Within minutes,
you will be dead.

789
00:31:22,012 --> 00:31:23,380
-Okay.
-Got it?

790
00:31:25,715 --> 00:31:28,452
LACEY (voice-over): Aaron peels
off the film marked A,

791
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,189
exposing the adhesive coating.

792
00:31:31,288 --> 00:31:33,523
He then applies the strip
to Dave's palm.

793
00:31:33,624 --> 00:31:36,227
-Okay... -Aaron will then
remove the film marked B,

794
00:31:36,326 --> 00:31:38,229
exposing the ricin.

795

-Okay.

It is critical that he keeps
his hand open

of the strip

811

in his jacket pocket,
which will be lined

-You're dead.

818

All right, Mr. Skylark,
so you'll just place

819
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,460
the ricin case
in this pouch here.

820
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,594
It will magnetically seal,

821
00:32:43,693 --> 00:32:45,296
and then you're good to go.

822
00:32:45,395 --> 00:32:47,965
So you want me
to carry this bag?

823

This is the bag.

It's, like, bulky.

Please remember, gentlemen,
you are entering into

His people revere him as a god.

They'll believe anything

842
00:33:25,202 --> 00:33:29,240
he tells them, including that
he can speak to dolphins

843
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:31,241

and defecate.

You're telling me my man
doesn't pee or poop?

I'm telling you he does,
and he lies

to his people
and they believe him.

848

Everybody pees and poops.

Where would it go otherwise?
He'd explode.

00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:48,318
This is like a dragon dog.

1117
00:44:48,418 --> 00:44:50,988
Is that a fucking...

1118
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,289
Guys, what am I looking for?
I don't know...

1119
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:53,923
It's like a big dog

1120
00:44:54,023 --> 00:44:55,159
that's orange.

1121
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:56,726
-(low growl)
-It's got stripes.

1122
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:59,129
It's like a big ,orange,
stripey dog.

1123
00:44:59,228 --> 00:45:00,730
(deep growling)

1124
00:45:04,067 --> 00:45:06,003
There's a tiger.

1125
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:07,403
It's a fucking tiger.

1126
00:45:07,503 --> 00:45:08,871
(whispering):
It's a fucking tiger.

1127
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:10,040
Yes.

1128
00:45:10,139 --> 00:45:11,474
A tiger.

1129
00:45:11,574 --> 00:45:14,010
You fucking led my friend
into a tiger patch?

1130
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:15,211
I told you
there were tigers there.

1131
00:45:15,311 --> 00:45:17,014
Guys, I'm very unhappy
right now.

1132
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:18,014
Look, it's really dark
out there.

1133
00:45:18,114 --> 00:45:19,248
He probably doesn't see you.

1134
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:21,785
-Oh, it fucking sees me.
-(tiger snarls)

1135
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,354
-It ha-- it has night vision.
-They have night vision?

1136
00:45:24,454 --> 00:45:26,323
That tiger has
night vision goggles?

1137
00:45:26,422 --> 00:45:27,924
It doesn't have
night vision goggles.

1138
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:29,860
It just naturally has night...

1139
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,260
-(shouting) -Listen,
just keep the line clear,

1140
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,429
Dung Beetle, please?

1141
00:45:32,528 --> 00:45:34,264
Aardvark is in trouble.

1142
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:35,898
What do I do? What do I do?

1143
00:45:35,998 --> 00:45:37,300
(over radio):
Talk to me, talk to me.

1144
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,935
I didn't want it
to come to this,

1145
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:40,170
but you're gonna have
to fight that tiger.

1146
00:45:40,269 --> 00:45:42,271
No, do not!
Do not fight the tiger!

1147
00:45:42,371 --> 00:45:44,774
Do not be a gentleman, you go
right for the fucking balls.

1148
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:46,175
(whimpering):
I don't see its balls.

1149
00:45:46,275 --> 00:45:47,877
Do not fight the tiger!
You will lose!

1150
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:50,180
If that's a girl tiger,
you got to cunt punt that bitch.

1151
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,349
-Dave, shut the fuck up.
-Cunt punt that fucking bitch!

1152
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:54,184
Please tell me you know
that that's a stupid idea.

1153
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:56,286
Please, please don't try
to fight the tiger.

1154
00:45:56,385 --> 00:45:58,822
(snarling, growling)

1155
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,057
I'm gonna make a run for it.

1156
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:01,125
LACEY:
Do not run for it!

1157
00:46:01,224 --> 00:46:02,125
You will die.

1158
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:03,460
It's coming. (screams)

1159
00:46:04,893 --> 00:46:06,362
You go, go, go, buddy!
Go, buddy!

1160
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:07,798
Look out, look out!
It's coming after you!

1161
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:08,932
It's coming after you!

1162
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:10,834
(screaming continues)

1163
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,903
(tiger groans)

1164
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:16,507
(panting)

1165
00:46:18,373 --> 00:46:19,976
(exhales)

1166
00:46:21,476 --> 00:46:23,480
-Oh, God, I'm alive.
-Aaron!

1167
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:25,481
-I'm alive.
-(sighs)

1168
00:46:25,581 --> 00:46:26,817
Are you in the tiger, Aardvark?

1169
00:46:26,916 --> 00:46:28,085
Are you inside the tiger?

1170
00:46:28,184 --> 00:46:29,085
LACEY:
Are you okay?

1171
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:30,320
Do you have the package?

1172
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,956
This is Aardvark.

1173
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:34,925
I think the package just killed
the fucking tiger.

1174
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:37,961
Fantastic.
You have to secure the package.

1175
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:39,496
Secure
the motherfucking package.

1176
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:42,266
(Aaron grunting with effort)

1177
00:46:45,534 --> 00:46:47,870
He's got the package.
He has the package.

1178
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,273
I got it; what do I do with it?

1179
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:50,407
Aardvark,
there are people coming.

1180
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:51,942
You have to act now.

1181
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:53,576
Secure the package,
secure the package.

1182
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:55,312
-What do I do with it? -They're
coming right towards you.

1183
00:46:55,411 --> 00:46:56,512
They're gonna see it,
they're gonna see it.

1184
00:46:56,612 --> 00:46:57,547
You got to hide
that little missile.

1185
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,916
I have to hide it somewhere?

1186
00:46:59,016 --> 00:46:59,983
Where the fuck do I hide it?

1187
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:01,418
(sighs)

1188
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:04,855
What do I do with it?
What do I do with it?

1189
00:47:07,322 --> 00:47:09,425
What if you hide it
in your butt?

1190
00:47:11,027 --> 00:47:13,530
I don't want to stick it
in my ass.

1191
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,298
You got to put it
in your butt, Aardvark.

1192
00:47:15,398 --> 00:47:16,365
Comm One, please tell me
I don't have

1193
00:47:16,465 --> 00:47:17,433
to stick this think in my ass.

1194
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:18,969
Okay, you're right. Just give us

1195
00:47:19,068 --> 00:47:20,436
one second
to come up with a better plan.

1196
00:47:20,536 --> 00:47:22,872
Isn't there anywhere else
I could secure it?

1197
00:47:22,972 --> 00:47:24,875
I think he should put it
in his asshole.

1198
00:47:24,974 --> 00:47:26,175
We don't have a better plan.
You're going to have

1199
00:47:26,275 --> 00:47:27,310
to stick it in your ass.

1200
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:29,278
No! No!

1201
00:47:29,378 --> 00:47:30,547
No!

1202
00:47:30,646 --> 00:47:32,481
I've never done that.

1203
00:47:32,581 --> 00:47:34,083
I've been there before.
It looks huge.

1204
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,620
That tiger blood
will lubricate it.

1205
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:38,288
This will mess up my asshole!

1206
00:47:38,387 --> 00:47:40,423
Aardvark,
there-there are people there.

1207
00:47:40,523 --> 00:47:41,991
They are closing in on you.

1208
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:43,093
They have guns.

1209
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,429
You need to secure the payload

1210
00:47:45,528 --> 00:47:46,896
and you need
to secure it in your ass.

1211
00:47:46,996 --> 00:47:47,897
DAVE:
Just stick it in your butt.

1212
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:49,298
Okay, fine, fine.

1213
00:47:49,398 --> 00:47:50,933
I'm there with you, bro.

1214
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,970
Just listen to the soothing
tones of my voice.

1215
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,071
Just breathe.

1216
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:55,338
Oh, it's cold.

1217
00:47:55,438 --> 00:47:56,639
DAVE:
Just let everything go loose.

1218
00:47:56,739 --> 00:47:57,573
Oh, I don't like it!

1219
00:47:57,673 --> 00:47:59,342
The tip is...

1220
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:00,944
it's the worst part.

1221
00:48:01,043 --> 00:48:02,311
Trust me on this.

1222
00:48:02,411 --> 00:48:03,579
-DAVE: Inhale as you do it.
-(Aaron squeals)

1223
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:06,415
(feedback squeals)

1224
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:08,117
The tip of the package
is secure.

1225
00:48:08,217 --> 00:48:09,952
Comm One,
that thing is in his butt.

1226
00:48:10,052 --> 00:48:12,054
Owie, owie.

1227
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:14,191
You are almost
in the end zone, Aardvark.

1228
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:15,359
Just take it home.

1229
00:48:15,458 --> 00:48:18,327
(groans, gasps)

1230
00:48:23,532 --> 00:48:25,201
The package is secure.

1231
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:26,436
LACEY:
You are a hero.

1232
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:28,238
You are a goddamn hero.

1233
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:29,373
-(men shouting) -All right,
they're coming, they're coming.

1234
00:48:29,472 --> 00:48:31,240
I got to go. Over and out.

1235
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,043
(shouting in Korean)

1236
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:34,510
Hi! Aah! Don't shoot me.

1237
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:35,444
Oh, God!

1238
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:38,148
(barking)

1239
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,950
(shouting in Korean)

1240
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:44,354
(screaming)

1241
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:47,157
Don't hurt me, please!

1242
00:48:48,257 --> 00:48:49,259
See? There's nothing in here.

1243
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:50,293
There's nothing in here.

1244
00:48:50,393 --> 00:48:52,395
What?

1245
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:53,697
Oh, God, no!

1246
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:56,132
Ow!

1247
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:57,301
Come on!

1248
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,501
What the fuck?

1249
00:48:58,601 --> 00:49:00,636
Why? Why'd you do that?

1250
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:01,672
Why'd you do that?!

1251
00:49:01,771 --> 00:49:03,239
Is this what you want?

1252
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,008
There! You like it?!

1253
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,576
You like it?!

1254
00:49:06,675 --> 00:49:09,112
It's all yours, fuckers!

1255
00:49:09,211 --> 00:49:10,280
Stay in the room, American.

1256
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,414
(speaks Korean)

1257
00:49:13,016 --> 00:49:14,985
(dog barks,
guards mutter in Korean)

1258
00:49:18,721 --> 00:49:21,992
Hey, they're gone.
Did they look in your butt?

1259
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:24,126
-No, they didn't look in
my butt. -It's still in there?

1260
00:49:24,226 --> 00:49:26,096
-Yes, it's in there.
-Wow. Must be deep.

1261
00:49:26,195 --> 00:49:28,130
-It is.
-Get it out.

1262
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:29,599
I'm gonna fucking get it out.

1263
00:49:29,699 --> 00:49:31,434
I'm here to help.

1264
00:49:49,284 --> 00:49:51,120
-(toilet flushes)
-Hey.

1265
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:53,423
-How'd it go? -One ricin strip
with your name on it.

1266
00:49:53,523 --> 00:49:54,524
Got it.

1267
00:49:54,623 --> 00:49:56,759
All right.

1268
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,128
See, not so bad.

1269
00:49:58,228 --> 00:49:59,695
Yeah, not so bad.

1270
00:49:59,795 --> 00:50:01,163
-What?!
-Yeah.

1271
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:02,298
-That?
-This.

1272
00:50:02,398 --> 00:50:03,467
-In your bu...?
-Asshole.

1273
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,469
-No!
-Yes.

1274
00:50:05,568 --> 00:50:06,469
I was picturing
something, like, this big.

1275
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:07,637
Yeah, that I could live with.

1276
00:50:07,737 --> 00:50:09,172
As soon as you get home,

1277
00:50:09,271 --> 00:50:10,239
you need to see a proctologist.

1278
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,375
I'm afraid to fucking look.

1279
00:50:11,474 --> 00:50:13,342
You got fucked by RoboCop, dude.

1280
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:15,345
(knocking)

1281
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:17,780
Uh, who is it?

1282
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,615
It is, uh, Kim Jong-un.

1283
00:50:19,715 --> 00:50:21,150
What?

1284
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:24,321
Kim Jong-what?

1285
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:27,156
I am the Supreme Leader of,
uh, North Korea.

1286
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:28,358
What?

1287
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:29,659
What the fuck?

1288
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,061
-It's him.
-It's fucking him.

1289
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:32,229
What is he doing here?
What the fuck?

1290
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:33,330
Hide it, hide it, hide it.

1291
00:50:33,429 --> 00:50:34,330
-Put it back up.
-No.

1292
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:35,499
I'm not putting it back up.

1293
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,167
No, I'm gonna hide it
in my room.

1294
00:50:37,266 --> 00:50:38,467
-Okay. What do I do with this?
-Go say hi to him.

1295
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:39,435
Do I put it on right now?

1296
00:50:39,534 --> 00:50:41,170
No, then he'll die
when we're still here.

1297
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:42,239
-(knocking insistently)
-Put it in your pocket.

1298
00:50:42,338 --> 00:50:43,472
-Okay, fine.
-Okay, fine.

1299
00:50:43,572 --> 00:50:45,275
-Come with me.
-No, I got to hide this.

1300
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,110
-Aaron, just come with me.
-No, no...

1301
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,246
Aaron, Aaron.

1302
00:50:56,518 --> 00:50:58,754
Hi.

1303
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:01,123
Good morning, Dave.
(light chuckle)

1304
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,526
Good morning.

1305
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:04,361
Hi.

1306
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,529
Dave Skylark, ah.

1307
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:08,131
(chuckles)
It's crazy.

1308
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,766
(laughs)

1309
00:51:09,865 --> 00:51:11,300
Oh, I have a gift for you.

1310
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,435
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

1311
00:51:13,369 --> 00:51:15,105
This.

1312
00:51:15,204 --> 00:51:17,173
Oh, oh, this is me.

1313
00:51:17,273 --> 00:51:18,240
It's you.
(chuckles)

1314
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:19,608
Oh, that's great.

1315
00:51:19,708 --> 00:51:22,244
I always wanted
one of these-- a bust.

1316
00:51:22,344 --> 00:51:23,679
Dave Skylark.

1317
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:24,781
Hey!

1318
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,315
-Thank you.
-You like that?

1319
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,784
So you really like the show?

1320
00:51:27,884 --> 00:51:29,786
No, I might not show it,
but I'm freaking out.

1321
00:51:29,885 --> 00:51:31,153
You're like a superfan.

1322
00:51:31,253 --> 00:51:32,721
I really am.

1323
00:51:32,822 --> 00:51:34,124
Yeah.

1324
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:35,692
That's so cool.

1325
00:51:35,791 --> 00:51:38,127
Don't say something stupid, Kim.

1326
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:40,697
(sighs)
Okay, so I, uh,

1327
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:44,134
thought you might enjoy,
uh, breakfast

1328
00:51:44,233 --> 00:51:45,735
and a tour of my home.

1329
00:51:45,835 --> 00:51:47,804
I'd absolutely love to.

1330
00:51:49,271 --> 00:51:52,375
You know, I have to admit,
before I came here,

1331
00:51:52,407 --> 00:51:54,543
I thought this place
was gonna be a dump.

1332
00:51:54,643 --> 00:51:56,212
KIM (wry laugh):
Of course.

1333
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:58,581
For decades, you've heard
the false rumors:

1334
00:51:58,681 --> 00:52:00,583
"North Korea
is a failed state.

1335
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:02,619
We can't feed our people."

1336
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,454
-Yeah.
-It's all propaganda.

1337
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:06,423
I see.
Well, yeah, I mean...

1338
00:52:06,523 --> 00:52:08,291
I did see a fat kid

1339
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:10,327
and a really nice-looking
grocery store.

1340
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:13,463
Oh, we have beautiful grocery
stores here in North Korea.

1341
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:15,465
You know, one of my
favorite things to do

1342
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:17,767
is just strolling up
and down the aisles

1343
00:52:17,867 --> 00:52:20,303
to see the-the beautiful fruits
of my country's land.

1344
00:52:20,402 --> 00:52:21,737
I can believe that.

1345
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:24,341
It looks like you hit
the grocery store pretty often.

1346

-Very deep. Yeah.

00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:04,793
She has quite a
hearty moose knuckle.

1432

You Americans are so creative

1594
01:04:00,101 --> 01:04:01,903
Oh, shit. Oh, no. Oh, no.

1595
01:04:02,003 --> 01:04:03,206
(Yu speaking Korean)

1596
01:04:06,173 --> 01:04:07,909
-It's happening.
-(Yu speaking Korean)

1597
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:08,945
(gunshot)

1598
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:11,947
(everyone gasping)

1599
01:04:14,181 --> 01:04:17,085
(Kim shouting in Korean)

1600
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:18,421
(shouting)

1601
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:22,258
(shouting, sobbing)

1602
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:24,626
So gross.

1603
01:04:24,726 --> 01:04:27,028
(crying, shouting)

1604
01:04:27,128 --> 01:04:29,164
-(others crying)
-DAVE: Oh, no, no, no.

1605
01:04:29,264 --> 01:04:32,033
-(Kim shouting)
-Oh, no! Oh, no!

1606
01:04:34,936 --> 01:04:36,605
(speaking Korean)

1607
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,274
(sobbing)

1608
01:04:38,373 --> 01:04:42,043
-Oh, no. Oh, no.
-(Dave sobbing)

1609
01:04:42,143 --> 01:04:45,513
(everyone wailing)

1610
01:04:51,719 --> 01:04:54,189
(growls) It's okay, man.

1611
01:04:54,289 --> 01:04:55,458
No.

1612
01:04:55,557 --> 01:04:56,893
Come on, man.

1613
01:04:56,992 --> 01:04:59,327
We just killed two innocent men.

1614
01:04:59,427 --> 01:05:00,929
Look, Dave, first of all,

1615
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:02,999
it's not your fault
that those men died.

1616
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:04,467
Second of all, they had to go.

1617
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:05,902
They knew we were
up to something.

1618
01:05:07,469 --> 01:05:10,206
-I'm out.
-What?

1619
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:12,208
-You cannot pull out of this.
-I'm pulling out.

1620
01:05:12,307 --> 01:05:13,643
-You're way too deep
to pull out. -I'm pullin' out.

1621
01:05:13,742 --> 01:05:15,076
No, you are not.
You are leaving it in.

1622
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:16,545
I been pullin' out
for years, son.

1623
01:05:16,644 --> 01:05:19,014
You are not fucking
pulling out of this mission.

1624
01:05:19,114 --> 01:05:20,282
That's the only reason
we're here.

1625
01:05:20,382 --> 01:05:21,650
We are doing this!

1626
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,019
Kim is not evil.

1627
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:24,653
He was just born
into a hard situation.

1628
01:05:24,753 --> 01:05:27,690
You are fucking stupid, and you
are fucking ignorant, Dave.

1629
01:05:30,659 --> 01:05:33,128
-Mm!
-Ugh!

1630
01:05:33,228 --> 01:05:35,096
-Who you calling ign'ant?
-You, motherfucker.

1631
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:37,532
You're fuckin' arrogant.

1632
01:05:37,632 --> 01:05:39,401
Everything he's
shown you is fake.

1633
01:05:39,501 --> 01:05:41,503
He's shown you
what you want to see.

1634
01:05:41,603 --> 01:05:43,105
He's fooled you,
you fucking idiot!

1635
01:05:43,204 --> 01:05:46,375
God, look how ready
you are to betray me.

1636
01:05:46,474 --> 01:05:50,112
This whole time I thought you
were Samwise to my Frodo.

1637
01:05:50,211 --> 01:05:52,514
But you're just Boromir.

1638
01:05:52,614 --> 01:05:54,049
I don't know
who the fuck that is.

1639
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:55,318
"I don't know who Boromir is."

1640
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:56,519
That's such a Boromir thing
to say.

1641
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:57,987
This is fuckin' done.

1642
01:05:58,086 --> 01:05:59,521
You are fuckin' done
after this.

1643
01:05:59,621 --> 01:06:01,990
Once you kill this motherfucker,
this shit's over.

1644
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:03,558
But you are going to kill him!

1645
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:05,427
You've just turned me into
a gun, and you're pointing me

1646
01:06:05,527 --> 01:06:06,962
at the one guy
who actually gets me.

1647
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:09,265
Well, you know what, cowboy?

1648
01:06:09,364 --> 01:06:12,367
A gun can't fire
without no bullets.

1649
01:06:12,467 --> 01:06:13,735
What the fuck are you doing?!

1650
01:06:13,835 --> 01:06:17,138
-No, no, no, no, no, no!
-Yes, yes! Yes, yes!

1651
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:19,175
(grunting)

1652
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:20,675
Do you realize
what you just did?

1653
01:06:20,775 --> 01:06:22,077
I just saved a life,
you murderer.

1654
01:06:22,177 --> 01:06:24,679
-You piece of fu...
-Mr. Skylark.

1655
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:26,615
The Supreme Leader requests
your presence

1656
01:06:26,715 --> 01:06:28,217
at a restaurant
in Pyongyang for dinner.

1657
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:31,420
He will be at your door
in 30 minutes.

1658
01:06:43,565 --> 01:06:45,400
Hey, Dave.

1659
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:48,604
Thank you for being with me
in my time of sorrow.

1660
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:50,439
(sighs)

1661
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:54,410
That was super-gross
and fucked-up.

1662
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:56,045
AARON:
Hi.

1663
01:06:56,144 --> 01:06:58,581
Uh, Mr. Supreme Leader.

1664
01:06:58,681 --> 01:06:59,782
I'm Aaron.

1665
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:03,719
-Aaron?
-Hello.

1666
01:07:03,818 --> 01:07:07,623
Uh, we never got a chance to
formally meet, Mr. Great Leader.

1667
01:07:07,722 --> 01:07:10,659
I just wanted
to shake your hand.

1668
01:07:10,759 --> 01:07:14,663
Well, any friend of Dave
is a friend of mine.

1669
01:07:19,601 --> 01:07:21,737
(slow, distorted):
Uh-huh.

1670
01:07:27,608 --> 01:07:29,511
(slow, distorted):
No!

1671
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:31,280
-Don't shake that hand.
-Why not?

1672
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:32,548
Yeah, why not?!

1673
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:34,216
Because Aaron's a Jew.

1674
01:07:34,315 --> 01:07:37,118
-Oh, gross.
-Let's go, Supreme Leader.

1675
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:38,621
Okay. It was nice
meeting you.

1676
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,755
Don't you know Jews
are bad luck?

1677
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:43,292
(quietly):
Fuck you, fuck you!

1678
01:07:43,391 --> 01:07:44,759
Friends don't kill
friends' friends.

1679
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:46,394
(hissing)

1680
01:07:46,494 --> 01:07:47,762
(panting)

1681
01:07:47,862 --> 01:07:50,165
Okay. Okay.

1682
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:52,568
Oh, fuck.

1683
01:07:53,902 --> 01:07:56,704
(knocking on door)

1684
01:07:58,472 --> 01:08:00,409
Mr. Rapoport, we need to review
some new data

1685
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:02,677
the Leader wants included
in tomorrow's interview.

1686
01:08:02,777 --> 01:08:05,080
Now's not really the best time.

1687
01:08:05,181 --> 01:08:07,383
It will only take a moment.

1688
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:09,785
Yeah, okay.

1689
01:08:09,885 --> 01:08:11,487
-Great.
-Thank you.

1690
01:08:11,586 --> 01:08:13,655
SOOK: Would you like
to share a drink?

1691
01:08:13,755 --> 01:08:16,257
(men speaking Korean)

1692
01:08:16,358 --> 01:08:18,094
-(men speaking Korean)
-DAVE: Raise your glasses.

1693
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:19,862
Koh and Yu!

1694
01:08:19,962 --> 01:08:24,600
Koh and Yu possessed the finest
trait men can have:

1695
01:08:24,699 --> 01:08:26,801
Loyalty.

1696
01:08:26,902 --> 01:08:28,436
DAVE: I know how you feel.
My dog Digby died

1697
01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:31,407
when I was a kid, and I'm still
fucked up about it.

1698
01:08:34,542 --> 01:08:37,746
Loyalty is what
made my father

1699
01:08:37,845 --> 01:08:39,814
and grandfather
so successful.

1700
01:08:39,914 --> 01:08:42,451
That's right. Listen up.
Hey, listen up. You.

1701
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:44,420
KIM:
Without loyalty,

1702
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,856
a country is a lawless jungle.

1703
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:49,757
-(Jong speaks Korean)
-(men respond in Korean)

1704
01:08:49,858 --> 01:08:52,328
Welcome to the jungle, baby.
Welcome to the jungle.

1705
01:08:52,427 --> 01:08:54,896
On your
sh-n-n-n-n-n-n knees.

1706
01:08:54,997 --> 01:09:00,302
How else can I prevail
against so many enemies?

1707
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:02,203
Defectors.

1708
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:04,140
South Korean capitalists.

1709
01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:06,474
The people in this room...

1710
01:09:06,574 --> 01:09:09,478
who don't think I can fill
my father's shoes!

1711
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:12,848
These bastards
deserve no humanity!

1712
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:17,920
To those who seek
to undermine me,

1713
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:20,189
at home and abroad,

1714
01:09:20,288 --> 01:09:23,224
I cannot respond
with anything less

1715
01:09:23,324 --> 01:09:26,862
than the totality
of my strength!

1716
01:09:26,962 --> 01:09:30,633
If a billion people across the
Earth and in my own country

1717
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:32,735
must be burned to prove it

1718
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:36,337
then my worthiness as a Kim

1719
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:38,806
will be demonstrated!

1720
01:09:48,617 --> 01:09:51,186
DAVE:
Um...

1721
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:54,289
Hey, Kim, I gotta go outside.

1722
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:56,192
Is that okay?
I'm just feelin'...

1723
01:09:56,292 --> 01:10:00,196
Too much, uh,
s-s-soju, whatever.

1724
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:02,798
Okay.
(chuckles nervously)

1725
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:04,533
I'll be back.

1726
01:10:04,632 --> 01:10:07,970
So how'd you wind up
as one of the heads

1727
01:10:08,069 --> 01:10:09,837
of a, uh, dictatorship?

1728
01:10:09,938 --> 01:10:11,507
Ah.

1729
01:10:11,606 --> 01:10:13,509
One day, party officials
came to my classroom

1730
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:15,411
in search of a young woman

1731
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:17,780
to serve on the Kim
family personal staff.

1732
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,583
They selected me.

1733
01:10:20,682 --> 01:10:22,318
Over the years,

1734
01:10:22,417 --> 01:10:24,385
I grew close
with Kim Jong-un.

1735
01:10:24,485 --> 01:10:27,789
When he rose to power,
he took me with him.

1736
01:10:29,457 --> 01:10:31,794
And here I am.

1737
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:34,563
Kinda have a guy like that
in my life, too.

1738
01:10:34,662 --> 01:10:37,665
You've been with Dave
a long time.

1739
01:10:37,765 --> 01:10:39,467
He's a hard guy to leave.

1740
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:41,403
You just like the money
and can't say no to Dave.

1741
01:10:41,502 --> 01:10:43,538
No... (laughs)

1742
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:45,807
Yes! I know you.

1743
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:47,843
You're fuckin' awesome.

1744
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:50,546
-No, I don't understand you.
-And it's a little bit weird.

1745
01:10:50,645 --> 01:10:52,847
I mean, do you have a boyfriend
in this country?

1746
01:10:52,948 --> 01:10:56,352
Is that too forward
of me to ask?

1747
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:59,454
What are you lookin' at?

1748
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:02,658
-I should leave.
-Why?

1749
01:11:02,757 --> 01:11:05,961
I'm concerned my feelings
of attraction for you

1750
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:08,264

1751
01:11:08,363 --> 01:11:10,331
Your feelings

1752
01:11:10,431 --> 01:11:12,867

Ever since I saw you on that
mountaintop,

1755
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:17,840
this is all I've been
thinking about.

You're hairy, you're

You're fucking sexy, yeah.

-No hands?

I'm not into handsy shit.

That's how I like it.

Well...

How do I get it off?

1797
01:13:45,052 --> 01:13:48,090
Use your big, fat
American teeth.

Okay, I will!

Oh, shit, what's wrong?

1807
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:13,882
The numbers I gave you
on potato output...

1808
01:14:13,981 --> 01:14:16,018
are exaggerated.

1809
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:17,653
That's okay with me.
I don't really care about that.

1810
01:14:17,752 --> 01:14:18,820
If you want,
you can give me

1811
01:14:18,921 --> 01:14:20,588
the real numbers,
and we can get back

1812
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:23,492
-to what we were doing.
-No, it's not just the numbers.

1813
01:14:23,591 --> 01:14:25,493
I am a terrible person.

1814
01:14:25,594 --> 01:14:26,595
No, you're not.
You're the best person.

1815
01:14:26,694 --> 01:14:27,996
You were about
to have sex with me.

1816
01:14:28,095 --> 01:14:29,764
That's like the best thing
someone could do.

1817
01:14:29,864 --> 01:14:33,601
I'm the propagandist of a
totalitarian dictatorship.

1818
01:14:33,702 --> 01:14:35,604
That's an area
you could improve,

1819
01:14:35,703 --> 01:14:38,139
but, you know, you don't have
to dwell on it or anything.

1820
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:42,176
He's as cruel as his father
and grandfather before him.

1821
01:14:42,277 --> 01:14:43,846
You knew this
this whole time.

1822
01:14:43,945 --> 01:14:45,948
Why is this just
bothering you now?

1823
01:14:46,047 --> 01:14:47,949
It's been bothering
me for a long time,

1824
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:50,918
and I'm not the only one,

1825
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:54,923
but too many people
see him as a god.

1826
01:14:55,023 --> 01:14:57,826
How do you prove to
24 million people

1827
01:14:57,926 --> 01:15:01,630
that their god is a
murderer and a liar?

1828
01:15:01,729 --> 01:15:03,631

-DAVE: Aaron, I need to talk.

Fuck, it's Dave-- shit.

1830
01:15:05,132 --> 01:15:06,167
(knocking)

1831
01:15:06,268 --> 01:15:07,869
You, you hide in there,
I'll be back.

1832
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:10,072
-I'll go deal with him.
-Okay, go, go, go...

1833
01:15:10,171 --> 01:15:11,772
Oh, shit.

1834
01:15:11,872 --> 01:15:14,576
-Aaron, are you here?
-Yeah, one sec, uh, one sec.

1835
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:17,513
-One sec-- don't come in,
don't come in! -I need to talk.

1836
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:19,181
Hey, how's it going, dude?

1837
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:20,815
-Not good.
-Uh, maybe now's

1838
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:22,117
not a good time, maybe
we should take a walk.

1839
01:15:22,216 --> 01:15:24,652
No, no, no, no,
I can't walk this off.

1840
01:15:24,752 --> 01:15:25,820
I cannot walk this off.

1841
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:27,122
I need to...

1842
01:15:27,221 --> 01:15:28,590
(groans)

1843
01:15:28,689 --> 01:15:29,857
I'm so fucking pissed.

1844
01:15:29,957 --> 01:15:31,058
I just want to hit something!

1845
01:15:31,158 --> 01:15:32,094
No, no!

1846
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:33,295
No, don't punch anything!

1847
01:15:33,395 --> 01:15:34,997
(grunting)

1848
01:15:35,829 --> 01:15:36,832
Breathe.

1849
01:15:36,931 --> 01:15:38,733
Just breathe, maybe pace it out.

1850
01:15:38,833 --> 01:15:40,668
Fuck, man.

1851
01:15:40,769 --> 01:15:42,003
Kim.

1852
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:43,838
-Wha-What about him?
-He's going crazy.

1853
01:15:43,939 --> 01:15:45,207
He said he's going
to blow up the world

1854
01:15:45,306 --> 01:15:46,974
just to show that he's the shit.

1855
01:15:47,074 --> 01:15:48,710
And at first, I thought,

1856
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:50,946
"All right, maybe he's
just talking, you know,

1857
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:53,682
maybe he doesn't mean it."

1858
01:15:53,782 --> 01:15:56,851
Then I saw this fake
fucking grapefruit.

1859
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:57,985
What?

1860
01:15:58,953 --> 01:16:00,689
All the food
in that grocery store is fake!

1861
01:16:00,788 --> 01:16:02,090
He fucking lied to me.

1862
01:16:02,189 --> 01:16:04,826
Maybe that, maybe that
fat kid isn't fat.

1863
01:16:04,926 --> 01:16:08,830
I mean, oh, what about
the concentration camps?

1864
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:09,965
And the famine--
maybe that's real.

1865
01:16:10,064 --> 01:16:12,033
God!

1866
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:14,735
It is-- I've been telling you
that for weeks now.

1867
01:16:14,836 --> 01:16:15,971
He fucking honeydicked me.

1868
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:18,105
He honeydicked
the shit out of me.

1869
01:16:18,206 --> 01:16:20,242
-Sucks.
-You still got that poison?

1870
01:16:23,344 --> 01:16:25,846
You can't speak?
What the fuck?

1871
01:16:25,947 --> 01:16:27,748
I want to know
if you have the fucking poison

1872
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:30,252
-so we can kill
that motherfucker. -What?!

1873
01:16:30,351 --> 01:16:31,920
Whoa, ho, spy!
What the hell?!

1874
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:33,722
-She's on our side!
-Fuck's going on here?!

1875
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:35,257
-You can trust me, I'm okay.
-You can trust her, man!

1876
01:16:35,356 --> 01:16:37,759
Trust her?! Are you joking?!
We got to kill her.

1877
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:39,895
-Oh, my God, what are you doing?
-Dude, I was in bed with her!

1878
01:16:39,994 --> 01:16:41,128
-What?!
-We're hooking up.

1879
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:42,631
-That's why she's here.
-What?!

1880
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:44,065
Let him go; everything is fine.

1881
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:45,266
Now we got to kill
the girl that you like.

1882
01:16:45,367 --> 01:16:46,802
This is
the worst moment ever!

1883
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:48,369
We're not killing her!

1884
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:49,905
(both grunt)

1885
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:51,340
-DAVE: She's loyal to Kim.
-No!

1886
01:16:51,439 --> 01:16:54,609
Dude, she was just telling me
she's with us.

1887
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:55,743
I hate Kim.

1888
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:57,813
He is a terrible leader.

1889
01:16:57,912 --> 01:16:59,080
-See?
-Okay.

1890
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:00,815
She can help us kill him.

1891
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:02,684
What?
No, no, no killing.

1892
01:17:02,783 --> 01:17:03,684
Kim must die.

1893
01:17:03,784 --> 01:17:05,186
That's the American way.

1894
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:08,190
How many times can the U.S. make
the same mistake?

1895
01:17:08,289 --> 01:17:09,824
As many times as it takes.

1896
01:17:09,925 --> 01:17:11,393
Killing Kim won't change
anything.

1897
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:12,761
You said it yourself.

1898
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:14,395
We got to do
something, right?

1899
01:17:14,496 --> 01:17:15,931
He will be replaced.

1900
01:17:16,030 --> 01:17:17,164
He has brothers,
he has other generals.

1901
01:17:17,265 --> 01:17:18,367
The people need

1902
01:17:18,466 --> 01:17:21,168
to be shown
that he is not a god,

1903
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:22,771
that he is a man.

1904
01:17:22,871 --> 01:17:24,773
Then they will be
ready for change.

1905
01:17:24,872 --> 01:17:26,942
Yeah, how?

1906
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:29,177
Interviewing him.

1907
01:17:29,277 --> 01:17:32,047
Everyone in North Korea
will be watching.

1908
01:17:32,146 --> 01:17:33,948
No... the interview's scripted.

1909
01:17:34,048 --> 01:17:37,252
His people are never going
to let me ask real questions.

1910
01:17:37,351 --> 01:17:39,654
Dave, I am his people.

1911
01:17:39,755 --> 01:17:40,721
She controls
the broadcast.

1912
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:43,025
I can't do political interviews.

1913
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:44,926
I do entertainment
interviews.

1914
01:17:45,025 --> 01:17:47,429
Dude, you can
fucking do this.

1915
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:49,431
-Yeah? -Yeah, you don't
interview with your brain.

1916
01:17:49,530 --> 01:17:51,065
You interview
with your heart.

1917
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:53,435
-True.
-Your emotion, Dave.

1918
01:17:53,534 --> 01:17:56,438
You get Kim Jong-un
to fucking cry like a baby

1919
01:17:56,537 --> 01:17:59,206
in front of all of North Korea?

1920
01:17:59,306 --> 01:18:00,942
They'll know he's not a god.

1921
01:18:01,042 --> 01:18:04,980
-I think I can do this.
-You can do it.

1922
01:18:05,079 --> 01:18:08,350
I'm Dave Skylark
and I can interview anyone.

1923
01:18:08,449 --> 01:18:09,818
Yeah, you can.

1924
01:18:09,917 --> 01:18:12,286
Let's take
this motherfucker down!

1925
01:18:12,386 --> 01:18:15,289
♪ ♪

1926
01:18:26,167 --> 01:18:28,236
-Oh, God, oh, God!
-Oh, ah!

1927
01:18:28,336 --> 01:18:30,172
-You got a lot
of pent-up energy! -(screaming)

1928
01:18:30,271 --> 01:18:31,172
Oh, God!

1929
01:18:33,474 --> 01:18:35,711
Okay, everything's ready.

1930
01:18:35,810 --> 01:18:36,844
Uh, you ready to rock?

1931
01:18:36,944 --> 01:18:37,978
Y-You memorize all those facts?

1932
01:18:38,078 --> 01:18:38,979
I'm ready, baby.

1933
01:18:39,079 --> 01:18:40,148
Great.

1934
01:18:40,247 --> 01:18:41,750
How many people
in concentration camps?

1935
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:42,784
200,000.

1936
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:43,851
How many people malnourished?

1937
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:45,052
16 million.

1938
01:18:45,153 --> 01:18:47,055
They spent $800 million
on nukes last year

1939
01:18:47,154 --> 01:18:50,425
and got $200 million
in food aid from the UN.

1940
01:18:50,524 --> 01:18:52,793
And I got more where
that came from, baby.

1941
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:55,262
Really good-- you're
going to nail this shit.

1942
01:18:55,363 --> 01:18:57,132
-I just wish we had a fucking
escape plan. -Why don't we go

1943
01:18:57,231 --> 01:18:59,266
-to Japan? -Well, 'cause it's
across the Sea of Japan.

1944
01:18:59,367 --> 01:19:01,036
-Why don't we swim?
-Can't swim that.

1945
01:19:01,136 --> 01:19:02,904
-Oh, I'm a good swimmer.
-It's really, really far.

1946
01:19:03,003 --> 01:19:04,405
-People have done it.
-Nope.

1947
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:06,208
-Yep, Michael Phelps did it.
-That's not true.

1948
01:19:06,307 --> 01:19:07,208
-(knocking)
-Okay. -Okay.

1949
01:19:08,009 --> 01:19:08,409
MAN:
Skylark, two-minute warning.

1950
01:19:09,377 --> 01:19:10,779
Just keep me on the air
as long as you can.

1951
01:19:10,878 --> 01:19:11,912
I will, man.

1952
01:19:12,012 --> 01:19:13,782
Maybe we won't get
out of here.

1953
01:19:13,881 --> 01:19:15,216
No, we might die.

1954
01:19:15,317 --> 01:19:17,786
I've had a great life.

1955
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:19,154
I had the best best friend.

1956
01:19:19,253 --> 01:19:21,890
Fucked more women
than Ellen DeGeneres.

1957
01:19:21,989 --> 01:19:23,425
And now it's time

1958
01:19:23,524 --> 01:19:25,760
for the North Korean people
to get their dicks wet.

1959
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:29,765
This is a perfect ending
for the tell-all.

1960
01:19:31,231 --> 01:19:35,170
As the two best friends
stared each other in the eyes,

1961
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:38,173
they knew
that this might be

1962
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:40,342
the end
of the long road,

1963
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:42,444
but they also knew

1964
01:19:42,543 --> 01:19:45,247
how much they meant to
each other, and even though

1965
01:19:45,346 --> 01:19:48,916
neither one could say it
out loud,

1966
01:19:49,016 --> 01:19:51,485
they were both thinking...

1967
01:19:51,586 --> 01:19:54,122
BOTH (whispering):
I love you.

1968
01:19:55,957 --> 01:19:58,059
Okay, man, you got this.

1969
01:19:58,158 --> 01:19:59,059
Okay.

(chuckles)

01:21:07,994 --> 01:21:09,430
Are you ready to share
with the world

1978
01:21:09,530 --> 01:21:11,399
that gorgeous smile of yours?

1979

Tonight, I think it's
your smile they want to see.

I have something for you.

1982
01:21:17,505 --> 01:21:19,140
What?!

1983
01:21:21,676 --> 01:21:22,878
What's this?

1984
01:21:22,978 --> 01:21:24,212
Open.

(gasps)

Aw... aw!

1987
01:21:32,753 --> 01:21:34,288
-(puppy whimpers)
-For me?

1988
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:36,291
For you.

1989
01:21:36,390 --> 01:21:39,094
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh...!

1990
01:21:39,194 --> 01:21:41,897
Oh, he's just like Digby.

1991
01:21:41,997 --> 01:21:43,097
Just like Digby.

1992
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:44,432
I think I'm gonna die.

1993
01:21:44,532 --> 01:21:46,368
-Oh, my God...
-Don't die, please.

1994
01:21:46,467 --> 01:21:48,435
Not till after the interview.
(laughing)

1995
01:21:48,536 --> 01:21:51,105
This dog is killing me
with cuteness.

1996
01:21:51,206 --> 01:21:53,108
-He's crazy cute.
-Can I keep it?

1997
01:21:53,207 --> 01:21:55,576
Take him home,
forever and ever.

1998
01:21:55,676 --> 01:21:57,912
(sighs happily)
Why?

1999
01:21:58,012 --> 01:22:02,617
I live a lonely life, Dave...

2000
01:22:02,716 --> 01:22:05,252
and it warms my heart to know

2001
01:22:05,353 --> 01:22:07,188
that there is someone
in this world

2002
01:22:07,287 --> 01:22:10,391
with whom I can truly be myself.

2003
01:22:10,492 --> 01:22:13,395
Whatever they say about you...

2004
01:22:15,128 --> 01:22:16,530
...they're wrong.

2005
01:22:16,631 --> 01:22:18,365
(quiet laugh)

2006
01:22:18,466 --> 01:22:21,202
I'm just me and I do my best.

2007
01:22:21,301 --> 01:22:22,403
You're my brother.

puppy whimpers)

KIM:
You're my brother.

2010
01:22:27,507 --> 01:22:29,344
Let's get this
out of the way, okay?

2011
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:31,112
-Okay.
-(chuckling): Okay.

2012
01:22:31,212 --> 01:22:33,648
DAVE: And what are
we gonna name you, huh?

2013
01:22:33,747 --> 01:22:35,549
You need a name?
Yes, you do.

2014
01:22:35,649 --> 01:22:37,418
(smooching lightly)

2015

(Dave continues smooching,
puppy yelps)

2016
01:22:41,588 --> 01:22:43,725
Look, look.
He looks just like Digby.

2017
01:22:43,824 --> 01:22:45,292
(Dave laughing)

2018
01:22:45,393 --> 01:22:47,362
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

2019
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:49,631
(in baby talk): We see you
in a minute. Bye-bye.

2020
01:22:51,431 --> 01:22:52,533
-Okay...
-KIM: Okay.

2021
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:54,368
-Shall we begin?
-Are you ready?

2022
01:22:54,469 --> 01:22:55,670
Shut the fuck up.

2023
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:56,671
Guys, it's starting!
It's starting.

2027

Good evening.

2028
01:23:08,115 --> 01:23:09,684
And good morning to our viewers
around the world.

2029
01:23:09,783 --> 01:23:11,518
I'm Dave Skylark.

2030
01:23:11,618 --> 01:23:15,523
Thank you for joining me for
this historic moment in history.

2031
01:23:15,622 --> 01:23:17,291
I'm with President Kim Jong-un

2032
01:23:17,391 --> 01:23:20,260
of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea.

2033
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:22,197
(over TV):
We are broadcasting

2034
01:23:22,296 --> 01:23:24,365
from a station
outside of Pyongyang

2035
01:23:24,466 --> 01:23:26,201
for this very special
edition of:

2036
01:23:26,301 --> 01:23:28,069
"Skylark Tonight."

2037
01:23:28,168 --> 01:23:29,403

2038
01:23:29,503 --> 01:23:31,605
(Dave sighs)
Thank you for joining me,

2039
01:23:31,706 --> 01:23:33,307
President Kim Jong-un.

2040
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:35,076
It is my pleasure, Dave.

2041
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:37,679
You know, there is so much
misunderstanding

2042
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:39,414
about North Korea

2043
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:41,382
and, uh, me personally.

2044
01:23:41,483 --> 01:23:43,418
-Mm-hmm.
-And I can't think of a man

2045
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:45,686
with greater intelligence
than you.

2046
01:23:45,787 --> 01:23:47,222
I am grateful

2047
01:23:47,322 --> 01:23:49,757
for this opportunity
for my government

2048
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:52,159
and for the international
community

2049
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:55,797
to forge a better relationship.

2050
01:23:55,896 --> 01:23:57,564
So you want to set
the record straight.

2051
01:23:57,664 --> 01:23:59,033
Indeed, Dave.

2052
01:23:59,134 --> 01:24:00,568
AARON (quietly):
Camera three.

2053
01:24:00,667 --> 01:24:02,103
DAVE:
Tensions between your nation

2054
01:24:02,203 --> 01:24:05,340
and South Korea are
at an all-time high.

2055
01:24:05,439 --> 01:24:08,509
It's fair to say that you're on
the brink of armed conflict.

2056
01:24:08,609 --> 01:24:11,179
So, what I want to know is:

2057
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:13,715
In these times of great stress,

2058
01:24:13,814 --> 01:24:15,582
do you do karaoke?

2059
01:24:15,682 --> 01:24:17,351
Yes, I do, Dave.

2060
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:21,056
I believe that it is important
for those in power

2061
01:24:21,155 --> 01:24:23,524
to remain in touch
with the beauty in life.

2062
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:26,661
You are also a very accomplished
painter, aren't you?

2063
01:24:26,761 --> 01:24:28,329
KIM:
Well, how can I not be?

2064
01:24:28,429 --> 01:24:29,730
He's reading
the scripted questions.

2065
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:31,666
AARON: He lulls them
and then he gets them.

2066
01:24:31,765 --> 01:24:33,268
It's his technique.

2067
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:34,669
The beauty guides you.

2068
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:36,237
It guides my hand.

2069
01:24:36,337 --> 01:24:38,773
This is fuckin' bullshit.

2070
01:24:38,872 --> 01:24:40,442
Let's take it to a serious tip.

2071
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:42,277
Supreme Leader Kim,
when...

2072
01:24:42,377 --> 01:24:44,145
the United States,

2073
01:24:44,244 --> 01:24:47,282
which has an enormous stockpile
of nuclear weapons,

2074
01:24:47,381 --> 01:24:52,453
insists that countries
like yours have none,

2075
01:24:52,554 --> 01:24:55,489
does that feel
hypocritical to you?

2076
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:57,859
Many Americans do not realize

2077
01:24:57,958 --> 01:25:00,161
that the war in North Korea

2078
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:02,864
was entirely the fault
of the United States.

2079
01:25:02,963 --> 01:25:05,699
Damn! Kim's callin' us out!

2080
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,668
-You really are still hopeful?
-No, no, I'm not

2081
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:10,171
hopeful at all.
He's totally bailed on the plan.

2082
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:12,306
America, what you done
to these Koreans?

2083
01:25:12,407 --> 01:25:14,409
This is a little embarrassing.

2084
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:17,244
So when you think of all that
your country has been through--

2085
01:25:17,345 --> 01:25:20,148
the wars, the floods--

2086
01:25:20,247 --> 01:25:22,683
do you think that your people
should be rewarded

2087
01:25:22,783 --> 01:25:25,786
for their resilience
and strength?

2088
01:25:25,886 --> 01:25:28,456
Of course, Dave.

2089
01:25:31,725 --> 01:25:33,561
Then why don't you feed them?

2090
01:25:36,796 --> 01:25:38,432
(speaking Korean)

2091
01:25:38,533 --> 01:25:39,734
-(murmuring)
-Hmm.. -Mm...

2092
01:25:41,435 --> 01:25:45,206
KIM (over monitor):
Uh... I...

2093
01:25:45,305 --> 01:25:47,207
AARON:
Camera two.

2094
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:50,912
I... beg your pardon?

2095
01:25:51,011 --> 01:25:53,280
Why don't you feed your people?

2096
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:54,481
They are hungry.

2097
01:25:54,582 --> 01:25:56,551
Specifically,
two-thirds of them?

2098
01:25:56,650 --> 01:25:58,920
Isn't that a little
embarrassing, since you're

2099
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:01,289
the one they view
as a provider and a god?

2100
01:26:01,389 --> 01:26:04,359
And you spend $800 million
on nukes every year?

2101
01:26:04,458 --> 01:26:05,926
And you have 16 million people

2102
01:26:06,027 --> 01:26:07,529
who are starving?

2103
01:26:13,533 --> 01:26:16,436
Are you sure you don't, uh...

2104
01:26:16,537 --> 01:26:19,173
mean to ask me
about potato yields?

2105
01:26:19,274 --> 01:26:20,508
No, I want to know

2106
01:26:20,608 --> 01:26:22,177
about that other thing
I just asked.

2107
01:26:22,277 --> 01:26:23,478
KIM:
Okay, uh, well, uh...

2108
01:26:23,578 --> 01:26:26,314
Dave, as you have seen
for yourself

2109
01:26:26,413 --> 01:26:29,184
we have a great bounty of food
in North Korea.

2110
01:26:29,283 --> 01:26:31,219
DAVE:
What I saw for myself

2111
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:34,589
was a fake grocery store

2112
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:36,891
with a fake fat kid planted
right in front of it.

2113
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,796
KIM:
Okay, uh, this is, uh...

2114
01:26:42,896 --> 01:26:44,731
an offensive
line of questioning.

2115
01:26:44,832 --> 01:26:47,268
I don't think it's offensive.
I think it's super important.

2116
01:26:47,368 --> 01:26:48,503
Obviously, if you don't want
to answer these questions,

2117
01:26:48,603 --> 01:26:49,671
you can just get up
and walk away.

2118
01:26:49,770 --> 01:26:51,738
I can't keep you
from retreating.

2119
01:26:51,838 --> 01:26:53,507
-He's gonna go for the button.
-He's not. He's sitting there.

2120
01:26:53,608 --> 01:26:55,476
-He's not moving.
-He's going for the button.

2121
01:26:55,576 --> 01:26:57,612
He's going for the button,
he's going for the button...

2122
01:26:57,712 --> 01:26:58,613
He's not. Oh, shit.
He's making a move!

2123
01:26:58,712 --> 01:27:00,881
Don't move, homie!

2124
01:27:00,981 --> 01:27:02,684
Get your hand away from there!
Get over there!

2125
01:27:02,783 --> 01:27:03,684
Over there!

2126
01:27:03,784 --> 01:27:04,885
Get over there!

2127
01:27:06,619 --> 01:27:07,654
I will cap you!

2128
01:27:07,755 --> 01:27:08,957
I'm exploding with energy.

2129
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:10,591
I can't believe
this is happening.

2130
01:27:10,692 --> 01:27:12,894
I feel so alive right now.
This is so real.

2131
01:27:12,993 --> 01:27:15,429
He's got him. Nice!

2132
01:27:15,529 --> 01:27:16,797
-Dave! Dave...
-I know you, Kim.

2133
01:27:24,805 --> 01:27:26,307
Dave...

2134
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:28,443
perhaps the question
you should ask is:

2135
01:27:28,542 --> 01:27:32,246
How have I managed to keep
my country so well-nourished

2136
01:27:32,346 --> 01:27:35,315
despite the harsh and unjust
economic sanctions

2137
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:39,386
imposed on North Korea
by the United States?

2138
01:27:39,487 --> 01:27:41,956
Sanctions? Uh...

2139
01:27:42,055 --> 01:27:43,790
Don't you know
that the United States

2140
01:27:43,890 --> 01:27:46,960
has more incarcerated people
per capita than North Korea?

2141
01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:48,929
-No. But...
-So, perhaps, now,

2142
01:27:49,029 --> 01:27:50,731
you would like to return

2143
01:27:50,832 --> 01:27:54,335
to the civil discussion
we had originally agreed upon.

2144
01:27:54,435 --> 01:27:56,471
DAVE (over TV):
Uh...

2145
01:27:56,570 --> 01:27:58,405
-No!
-(groaning, grunting)

2146
01:28:02,676 --> 01:28:04,612
AARON:
Oh, shit! Go to camera one!

2147
01:28:08,881 --> 01:28:10,851
Camera three! Camera three!

2148
01:28:15,823 --> 01:28:17,892
Do not move, homie!

2149
01:28:17,992 --> 01:28:20,360
-(crunching, cracking)
-(screaming)

2150
01:28:22,462 --> 01:28:26,367
(all screaming)

2151
01:28:26,466 --> 01:28:28,869
Give me something!
Give me fucking something!

2152
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:30,771
Okay...

2153
01:28:30,872 --> 01:28:32,707
Why?!

2154
01:28:32,806 --> 01:28:34,908
Fuck! Shit, that hurts!

2155
01:28:35,009 --> 01:28:37,511
We don't have
concentration camps, Dave.

2156
01:28:37,612 --> 01:28:39,846
Have you seen
one person mistreated

2157
01:28:39,947 --> 01:28:41,983
since your arrival here?

2158
01:28:45,618 --> 01:28:47,487
Oh, shit!
Someone's coming.

2159
01:28:47,587 --> 01:28:48,755
Someone's coming.

2160
01:28:50,157 --> 01:28:52,393
-(alarm blares)
-(shouting in Korean)

2161
01:29:02,636 --> 01:29:04,372
AARON:
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

2162
01:29:04,471 --> 01:29:07,375
Dave, unless you can show me
a person, a photo

2163
01:29:07,475 --> 01:29:08,609
of widespread hunger...

2164
01:29:08,708 --> 01:29:11,345
(yelling, groaning)

2165
01:29:15,481 --> 01:29:16,117
Aaron!

2166
01:29:21,622 --> 01:29:22,957
(shrieking)

2167
01:29:28,095 --> 01:29:29,497
(groaning)

2168
01:29:29,596 --> 01:29:31,498
Do not fuck with my angles!

2169
01:29:34,201 --> 01:29:35,403
(screaming)

2170
01:29:43,911 --> 01:29:46,047
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

2171
01:29:47,146 --> 01:29:48,582
You're fucking up
the angles!

2172
01:29:50,184 --> 01:29:51,386
Sit still!

2173
01:29:51,485 --> 01:29:53,520
Go wide, camera two!

2174
01:29:53,621 --> 01:29:55,523
Slow push!

2175
01:29:55,622 --> 01:29:57,524
(yelling and groaning continues
over Kim speaking)

2176
01:30:08,469 --> 01:30:10,538
Thank you!

2177
01:30:10,637 --> 01:30:12,606
Face it, Dave, you have failed.

2178
01:30:12,707 --> 01:30:16,110
You've made wild allegations
but you have proven nothing.

2179
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:17,811
You made this long journey

2180
01:30:17,912 --> 01:30:20,081
just to show the world that they
were right about you.

2181
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:24,117
You are incapable of
conducting a real interview.

2182
01:30:24,217 --> 01:30:26,753
You're a joke!

2183
01:30:29,722 --> 01:30:31,692
(sighs)
Maybe you're right.

2184
01:30:31,792 --> 01:30:34,829
Yeah, it sucks.

2185
01:30:34,929 --> 01:30:37,030
Because I need
people's approval.

2186
01:30:39,265 --> 01:30:40,734
Desperately.

2187
01:30:40,835 --> 01:30:42,103
Because I could never get it

2188
01:30:42,203 --> 01:30:44,572
from my father when I was a kid.

2189
01:30:51,912 --> 01:30:54,916
But I see a lot of
the same thing in you, Kim.

2190
01:30:56,115 --> 01:30:57,717
Your father...

2191
01:30:57,818 --> 01:31:02,590
deprived you of
life's simplest pleasures.

2192
01:31:03,756 --> 01:31:06,193
He told you
that margaritas are gay.

2193
01:31:06,293 --> 01:31:10,163
I have no comment on margaritas.

2194
01:31:10,264 --> 01:31:11,865
Then why don't you drink them?

2195
01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:14,635
I... don't like brain freeze.

2196
01:31:15,836 --> 01:31:17,605
KIM (on TV):
Fuck you, Dave.

2197
01:31:17,704 --> 01:31:20,675
You fucking asshole.

2198
01:31:20,774 --> 01:31:22,844
